On doing so, resist the incoming attack by one step, and inflict the @Affliction[fear] condition on the target for 5 activations. If you also have the Look Out perk, this is improved to a Free Action. You may opt to intercept as a free action in those circumstances without the added benefits of Fearsome Defense if you choose not to spend the activation cost.</p>",
