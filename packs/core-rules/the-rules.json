Consider this a more structured way to approach the concept of 'random encounters' in your world.</p>\n<h3>Racing Clocks</h3>\n<p>There will be occasions, typically where two parties are working in competition with one another, where you will want to use Racing Clocks. These clocks are typically Flexible Clocks and are used when either two parties are in opposition with one another, or the players are trying to complete a task before a danger clock fills - such as evacuating a town before the Volcano erupts. For this, players can seek ways to advance their own clocks or sabotage the opposing clock.</p>\n<h2>Keywords and Traits</h2>\n<p>Inspired off of the keywords and traits as used by the various <em>Warhammer</em> franchise games and <em>Pathfinder: Second Edition</em>, PTR2e includes a variety of <strong><Keyword>s</strong> and <strong>[Trait]s</strong> in order to classify things and grant rules.</p>\n<p>&lt;Keyword>s are fairly straight forward in that they are a category or collection of [Traits] and are used where you want to define a range of [Traits] but not necessarily a specific one. At its most basic, a <strong>[Trait]</strong> is generally a number of tags underneath a broader &lt;Keyword>, which acts as a whole category.

        "content": "<p>Creating a character is a straightforward process. There are nine individual steps to it that should be completed in order, though the final step may be appropriate to cut in certain campaign frameworks.</p>\n<h2>1 - Concept</h2>\n<p>This one is slightly nebulous, but the first thing you should do when making a character is consider what that character will be. What are you trying to achieve? How should this character play? What makes them tick? Do they have any prominent goals or affiliations? What is their history? The more you can come up with at this stage, the easier the rest of character creation should be.</p>\n<h2>2 - Species</h2>\n<p>In Pokemon Tabletop Reunited: Evolved, you are not necessarily limited to stock Human characters. You may play as a Pokemon, or in a campaign setting that supports it, you may find yourself as the likes of a Dwarf or an Elf. You should check with your GM what species they intend to allow.</p>\n<p>Our recommendation as developers is that you should try to stick to species with the [Underdog] trait, even if they have later evolutions which cease to be [Underdog]. For [Humanoid] type species, all of your Base Stats start at 40, and you have 110 Base Stat Points to allocate. At character creation, you can only increase any single Base Stat up to 90. In order to access the allocation for Base Stats and EVs, you should click on the stat radar on your character sheet. For Pokemon, the base stats will already be pre-allocated.</p>\n<p>Typically, Humanoids will gain the [Trainer] trait as part of the game's framework, and Pokemon would gain either [Explorer] or [Expedition Leader] traits depending on the nature of the game, but this is not always the case. A GM may wish to run a campaign where [Humanoid] characters gain the [Ranger] trait for example instead of [Trainer]. Check with your GM what comes with your framework as standard.</p>\n<h2>3 - Allocate Effort Values</h2>\n<p>Effort Values (or EVs) are assigned at character creation. There are 508 EVs to be distributed across the 6 stats, and these function almost exactly like they do in the Pokemon Video Games, though we have reduced the cap per individual stat to 200 EVs to reduce minmaxing. Don't worry too much about getting this perfectly right as there are ways in which your EV allocation can be altered during play if it's not working out how you had initially wanted.</p>\n<h2>4 - Nature</h2>\n<p>You must choose a dominant Nature for your character, regardless of species. This functions exactly like it normally would in terms of it's impact on stats. Be mindful that your character's Nature is not the totality of their personality, but it is meant to be a significant part of it.</p>\n<h2>5 - Allocate Skills</h2>\n<p>As all player characters receive the [Ace] trait, they gain a starting Skill Point budget of 400 points to allocate at level 1, while non-player characters (such as owned Pokemon) gain 110 skill points to allocate at level 1.</p>\n<p>All skills start at 1, or the base rating for your chosen species - whichever is higher. You may spend skill points from your budget to improve any skill you want, at a 1-for-1 ratio, up to a maximum of 70 points invested in any one skill.</p>\n<h2>6 - Perks</h2>\n<p>At level 1, [Humanoid] characters gain 20 advancement points to spend on the Perk Web, while [Pokemon] characters receive 10 advancement points to spend. These may be used to purchase Perks in the same manner that you would during character advancement. Your first Root node (characterised by the door icon) on the Perk Web is free to purchase.</p>\n<h2>7 - Gear</h2>\n<p>At this stage, select your starting gear. Typically, [Humanoid] characters will likely have the [Trainer] trait and would receive a standard Trainer Kit featuring a stack of basic balls, a stack of potions (and a suitable weapon, if appropriate to the campaign) with room to make additional pre-game shopping rolls or take items as agreed by the GM, while [Pokemon] characters would receive an Explorer's Kit featuring an Oran Berry and a Status Cure Berry of their choosing, if they have [Explorer] or [Expedition Leader].</p>\n<h2>8 - Determine Starting Luck</h2>\n<p>While most elements of character creation follow a point-buy basis, for Luck to feel right it should be truly random. As such, you would roll your starting Luck at this stage. To do so, roll 3d6 and multiply the final result by 5. Luck is a resource unique to creatures with the [Ace] trait.</p>\n<h2>9 - Choose Starter Pokemon</h2>\n<p>Finally, if playing a [Trainer], [Ranger], [Expedition Leader] or similar framework character, you should select your Starter Pokemon. This Pokemon does not receive the [Ace] trait but should be built using steps 1-6 and step 8 of the character creation process, with the initial skill points being reduced from 400 to 110 due to the lack of [Ace]. To reiterate, it is our recommendation that, like primary Player Characters, your starter Pokemon should be from a species with the [Underdog] trait by default, but always check with your GM what options are available in their campaign.</p>\n<p>GMs, we encourage you not to be too strict on what Starter Pokemon are available. Maybe don't allow a Duraludon starter, but don't be too afraid to let someone take a Dratini for example. The likes of psuedo-legendaries ultimately pay for their strength by being late bloomers.</p>\n<p>While a character could have a [Humanoid] companion instead of a [Pokemon] one, do please ensure that any companion characters do not have the [Trainer] or [Expedition] leader traits. In the case of a scenario like a [Ranger] framework, consider replacing the [Ranger] trait on any companion characters with [Cadet].</p>\n<h1>Character Advancement</h1>\n<p>Character advancement occurs between levels 1 and 100, as you accumulate experience points.</p>\n<p>Character advancement is very straightforward in itself. Your stats will automatically increase based on your EV investment.</p>\n<p>At each level, all actors gain 10 skill points to allocate to their skills, though at this stage the skill cap is lifted from 90 to 100. Evolutions may increase your skills above 100 - this serves to offer a cushion against penalties on skill checks for things your species is naturally adroit at.</p>\n<p>The Resources skill cannot be improved after character creation through the use of Skill Points. It can only be increased or reduced as a result of gameplay rewards and circumstances, which will be covered in more detail in our GM guidance.</p>\n<p>In addition to this, characters will receive Advancement Points (or AP). [Humanoid] characters receive AP at a rate of 1AP per level. [Pokemon] characters receive AP at a rate of 1 AP per 2 levels, earning an AP every even level. AP are used on the Perk Web to purchase Perks, which will have a cost between 0 and 5 depending on the Perk.</p>\n<p>Pokemon unlock ability slots at levels 1, 20, 50 and 80.</p>\n<p>All characters start at Grade 'E'. Accessing higher grades of Items, Moves, etc. may require Perks to obtain even with level ups.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For reference, a character’s Grade updates at the following levels: \n  Level 1 -&gt; Grade E<br />\n  Level 15 -&gt; Grade D<br />\n  Level 25 -&gt; Grade C<br />\n  Level 35 -&gt; Grade B<br />\n  Level 45 -&gt; Grade A</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Leveling Up</h2>\n<p>During your Journey in PTR2e one of the questions you’ll undoubtedly stumble upon will be: how are our levels set-up?</p>\n<p>While the full answer to this question is still up to debate; for now we have based level-ups around the Experience Tracks as they are in the Pokemon Mainline Video Games, where Humanoids follow the ‘Slow’ track while all Pokemon follow the ‘Faster’ track.

As part of these Actions, you will generally make some sort of Skill Check, and upon success, you progress that Downtime Action’s own Clock. Upon completing the Clock, you finish the activity and gain the reward from the activity. Many Downtime Activities possess special Clocks that persist from day to day, so you can progress a Clock and continue work on the Activity at another time.</p>\n<p>Downtime Actions consist of activities that may take an hour to do, or could possibly take multiple days or even weeks to resolve. Activities involved with Camping and Resting form a crucial slice of Downtime Actions, but others, such as <strong>Travelling</strong>, <strong>Crafting</strong>, and <strong>Projects</strong> are also Downtime Actions. Some Exploration Actions may be used instead as Downtime Actions, with varying effects: either the roll gains an increased bonus, can be done extra times, or has a completely unique effect when used as downtime.</p>\n<p>Downtime in general comes in two chief flavours. There is <em>structured downtime</em>, which is primarily constructed around the Camping subsystem, and <em>flexible downtime</em>, which typically takes the format of timeskips via the <a href=\"/rules/gm-tips#interludes\">Interludes optional toolset</a> until gameplay proper resumes again.</p>\n<p><em>Structured downtime</em> relates to the Day Clock's Spans as discussed above. Downtime Activities pass the Day clock, and the camping subsystem requires the commitment of at least two spans of time from the Day clock, in which one is committed to Rest and the other is dedicated to a Camp Activity.</p>\n<p><em>Flexible downtime</em> is mostly useful as a vehicle to pass a nebulous amount of time - or a fixed one where tracking the individual days would be cumbersome and take away from the gameplay experience. With flexible downtime, it is encouraged to discuss between players and GMs what could reasonably be achieved during the time skip and jump ahead.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong><em>Note to GMs</em></strong>: the nature of many of the assorted Downtime Actions are designed with the purpose of being meaningful, tactical uses of Player resources.

Of these two spans of time, one must be used for the 'Rest' <strong>Camp Action</strong>. The other may be used to perform another Camp Action from those that are available to you.</p>\n<p>Below we will detail the <strong>Camp Actions</strong> and how you can use them to interact with the game world.</p>\n<h2>Rest and Restore (R&amp;R)</h2>\n<p>The Rest and Restore action fully restores PP spent from the previous day, less any amounts pre-allocated as a result of Camp Actions taken before resting. As part of the Rest action, the effects of any Curry that has been made during this Camp are resolved (such as HP recovery). Rest also normally removes 1 stack of Weary but this can be blocked by the Exposure affliction.</p>\n<h2>Rest - Pokemon Center or Similar</h2>\n<p>Using the services of a Pokemon Center or similar institution, such as a healer, functions like a normal rest, with the exception of fully recovering HP, PP, Weary and Exposure without the use of a meal.</p>\n<h2>Cook</h2>\n<p>When a character opts to Cook, this allows them to spend time making a meal for the entire encampment. Individual meal recipes have specific effects that are either resolved during the Rest action, or carry over into the next day's play. For the purpose of the latter type of 'food buff', these typically last until the next Camp unless stated otherwise.</p>\n<h2>Change Active Moves</h2>\n<p>This particular Camp Action is considered a 'free' one. It enables you to alter your six active move slots by removing moves from the slot they currently occupy, and by adding moves from your repertoire into unoccupied move slots.</p>\n<h2>Quick-Crafts</h2>\n<p><em>To be determined.</em></p>\n<h2>Tutoring</h2>\n<p>Creatures can learn new attacks over the course of a Journey. This can be from <strong>Leveling Up</strong> (adding the Move directly to their Known Attacks List) or from <strong>Tutoring</strong>. Below are the rules for each way a creature can increase their stable of Known Moves.</p>\n<p>A creature can learn new attacks from a few methods, but the following basic rules apply regardless of the method:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A creature can only learn an attack they have on their Level-up List or their Tutor List.</li>\n<li>The attack needs to be accessible to learn in some way.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Creatures, mainly [Pokemon], may have Attacks they learn upon <strong>Leveling Up</strong> to a specific level. These attacks are learned as soon as the creature meets the level requirement, added to the Known Attacks List. <strong>Tutoring</strong> is a Camp Action that can be done by any creature using the Teaching skill, and is a simple but time consuming process. In order for a creature to learn a new attack this way, the following conditions must be met:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A creature must have the desired Attack on their \"Known Attacks\" List, and must take part in the Tutoring action (if you’re a Trainer facilitating the teaching of an attack one of your Pokemon knows to another Pokemon you have, all three of you participate).<ul>\n<li>If none of the involved creatures can meet this requirement, please, see the rules on <strong>Indirect Tutoring</strong> (below).</li></ul></li>\n<li>The target creature must be able to learn the attack, either from their level up list or on their Tutor list.</li>\n<li>A creature must be designated the Instructor of the Action. This sometimes is the creature that knows the attack, but oftentimes, a Trainer will act as the Instructor for their Pokemon, facilitating the cross-teaching of attacks between their owned Pokemon.</li>\n<li>All creatures taking part of the Tutor Activity must be in the active party.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When these conditions are met, a 6 Span Clock is created and the Instructor rolls a Challenging Teaching Skill Check. The Instructor may substitute their Teaching score for that of another creature involved in the Check, other than the Tutoring target (note: this substitution does not change who the Instructor is for the purposes of Perk effects).</p>\n<p>This roll is further modified by -20 for every Grade higher the attack is than the Target’s Grade, and conversely gets modified by +10 for every Grade lower the attack is than the Target’s Grade. For every DoS, 1 Span is filled. Every DoF increases the Clock by 1 Span, to a maximum of 12 Spans large.</p>\n<p>Once the Tutor Project Clock is filled, the target learns the new attack and adds it to their Known Attacks List.</p>\n<h4>Same Type Tutor Bonus (STTB)</h4>\n<p>A creature attempting to learn an attack that matches one of their \\<Type> Traits has their Clock start with 4 Spans instead of the usual 6 Spans.</p>\n<h3>NPC Tutoring</h3>\n<p>Sometimes, an NPC will offer their expertise or services to help Tutor a creature within the Party. Sometimes as a reward for a Quest, or perhaps gained through bargaining or roleplay on the Players' end, this NPC essentially acts as an involved creature in the standard operations for a Tutoring Action.</p>\n<h3>Indirect Tutoring</h3>\n<p>You might not always have access to a teacher, or are perhaps running off of a simple observation. You could be reviewing the records of a fierce battle between a Frontier Brain and a highly skilled challenger, reviewing a training manual, or trying to remember back to how getting hit by such an attack felt, or remembering how it looked in person.</p>\n<p>In these situtations where no one involved knows the Attack, you may engage in <strong>Indirect Tutoring</strong>. So to compensate with the situations where you don't have a proper teacher, Players have the capability to learn moves they've encountered, although doing so is much harder than with a proper teacher, <em>possessing a <strong>-60 Penalty</strong> to the normal Tutor Roll</em>.</p>\n<p>Having at least one of these in play allows you to tutor a Move, but a greatly decreased efficacy. Having this information in multiple forms does make this penalty lower, depending on the factor. These factors are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Party has access to a clear, readible recording of the Attack being used: <strong>+10</strong></li>\n<li>The Party has access to a simple manual or instructions of the attack: <strong>+10</strong><ul>\n<li>The manual is detailed: <strong>+20</strong></li>\n<li>The manual is comprehensive (either through extreme detail, or with additional factors to make instruction easier): <strong>+30</strong></li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This means that, with both a recording and a comprehensive manual, Indirect Tutoring of an attack would reduce the penalty to the Tutor Roll to <strong>-20</strong>, as opposed to the standard -60.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>TMs</h3>\n<p>TMs are valuable consumable tutoring items that can passively teach a creature a new attack. TMs are written as “TM - \\<Attack Name>”, and can be acquired from shops, loot or given as prizes. A TM can only be applied to one creature per Camp Action. New moves learned from TMs are added to the creature's Known Attacks List.</p>\n<h4>Crafting TMs</h4>\n<p>Any character that picks up the “TM Crafter” Perk can create TMs. This works similar to the Tutoring Camp Action but requires a Blank TM, one corresponding Type Gem, and the user must either know the desired attack, request a willing creature that knows the desired attack to provide it, or use the methods from <strong>Indirect Tutoring</strong> to craft it. </p>\n<p>When a character with TM Crafter starts to craft a TM, a 6 Span Crafting Project is created and a Challenging Electronics or Computers Skill roll is performed. This roll is further modified by -20 for every Grade higher the attack is than the User’s Grade. For every DoS, 1 Span is filled. Every DoF increases the Clock by 1 Span, to a maximum of 12 large. Once the Crafting Project Clock is filled, the TM is created and the materials are spent.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Note: Multiple TMs can be crafted this way from one crafting activity as long as the crafter has the materials available and attacks accessible. Unlike other crafting items, higher DoS do not allow more TMs to be made without spending additional materials.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Research</h2>\n<p>Research normally requires you to have access to proper materials, such as a library, and would need to be performed in a town or city. The Scholar perk gives you the means to utilise this action whilst camping out in the wilderness.</p>\n<p>When undertaking research, you must first identify the subject matter that you wish to study. The level of obscurity of the information determines the difficulty modifier of the Research skill check, while the level of detail required will determine the size of any Clocks required to complete the task.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <h3>Example Subject Matters and Difficulties</h3>\n  <p><strong>(+20) Easy</strong> - Finding out who the region's Gym Leaders are and what Pokemon are their Aces.<br />\n  <strong>(+0) Challenging</strong> - Finding out the egg group of an uncommon Pokemon that you are not already familiar with.<br />\n  <strong>(-10) Difficult</strong> - Finding out a list of subsidiary businesses owned by Devon Corp that they choose not to advertise publicly.<br />\n  <strong>(-40) Near Impossible</strong> - Finding out further information about Paradox Pokemon, Ultra Beasts or similar creatures.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If appropriate, GMs may wish to split up the information to be uncovered using the Research action and distribute it piecemeal as spans of the relevant Clock are completed.</p>\n<h2>Conceal Camp</h2>\n<p>You may make a Stealth or Survival skill check to hide the location of your camp. If successful, this activity will prevent increases to Danger Clocks that represent wandering hazards while camped. GMs will want to modify the difficulty of this check accordingly to represent the environment and the risk of wandering hazards.</p>\n<p>Be aware! If you were hoping to attract a pokemon with the delicious smell of curry, they may not be able to find a hidden camp!</p>\n<h2>Keep Watch</h2>\n<p>In the event that you lack the necessary skills to conceal your encampment, there is the alternative of Keeping Watch. This action won't prevent your camp being found by enemies, but it will allow you to spot them coming (with a skill check if necessary) to give you time to prepare your allies for danger.</p>\n<p>GMs, avoid making a habit of interrupting Rests with frequent ambushes if you can help it. It can add to the story at times, but don't be surprised if players don't appreciate being hit with challenges while HP and PP deprived and thinking that they're safe to sleep.</p>\n<h2>Breeding</h2>\n<p>Placeholder</p>\n<h2>Therapy</h2>\n<p>A Camp Action interacting with Shadow Pokemon. Placeholder.</p>\n<h2>First Aid</h2>\n<p>A placeholder for an action interacting with a potential Injuries optional rule.</p>\n<h2>Gather Resources</h2>\n<p>You can perform the Gather Resources exploration action whilst Camping.</p>\n<h2>Fishing</h2>\n<p>Fishing is a specialised variant of the Search For Pokemon exploration action that can be used whilst Camping. You search for Pokemon like you normally would, but this requires you to be camped within convenient distance of a body of water such as a river, a lake or the ocean. Naturally, this can only be used to find aquatic pokemon in these bodies of water.</p>\n<h2>Change Roster</h2>\n<p>If your world has access to Remote Boxes or other appropriate means, players can change their roster of Pokemon during Camp. If using \"Stable Play\" in a Mystery Dungeon or similar scenario, this is an appropriate time for players to change out which character from their Stable they are using. ((Consider outlining what Stable Play is for the unfamiliar.))</p>",

        "content": "<p>During your Journey in PTR2e one of the questions you’ll undoubtedly stumble upon will be: how are our levels set-up? </p>\n<p>While the full answer to this question is still up to debate; for now we have based level-ups around the Experience Tracks as they are in the Pokemon Mainline Video Games, where Humanoids follow the ‘Slow’ track while all Pokemon follow the ‘Faster’ track. The math for both you can <a href=\"#exp-math-for-nerds\">view below</a>, but since you won't be plugging away into your calculator as the math is handled by Foundry, what is more important to know is:</p>\n<h2>Rules surrounding level-ups</h2>\n<p>Whenever a character reaches an EXP Threshold they may immediately level-up; a GM might wish to delay a level-up until after a session or event occurs; but realistically due to the timing of when EXP is earned (more later) this shouldn’t be an issue.</p>\n<p>Whenever a level-up occurs, the following happens:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gain +10 to spend amongst any of your Skills (except &lt;Resources>)</li>\n<li>Gain +1 Advancement Point, you may immediately spend this in the Perk Web or save it for later.<ul>\n<li>This only triggers once every even level if you are a [Pokemon]</li>\n<li>Perks can only be purchased during level-up or while camping.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, to be able to level-up we of course must also be able to earn EXP. There are many different types of activities that will award experience; be it from Combat, Exploration, Contests or even Pokeathlons. Realistically; if an activity is something that isn’t “guaranteed” to succeed; it’s worthy of earning experience.</p>\n<p>But before we get into the exact details of the <strong>\"how\"</strong>; lets start of with the <strong>\"when\"</strong>.</p>\n<h1>When? Scenes &amp; Ventures</h1>\n<p>The primary time to hand out experience will be at the end of any given Scene or Venture.</p>\n<h2>Scene</h2>\n<p>A <em>Scene</em> is a narrative tool of semi-indeterminate length within a certain context, which can consist of one or multiple Situations. An example of a Scene would be: “Traveling from Pewter City to Mt. Moon”. It’s a situation that likely will take many in-game hours, but it is likely unnecessary to actually spend many play-hours in the scene itself.</p>\n<p>Along the road to Mt Moon your players may encounter some wild Pokemon, as well as help a lost kid find their way to the Pokemon Center, these Situations can be played out in many ways; the wild pokemon encounter may have started off as a Social situation during <a href=\"/rules/exploration\">Exploration Activities</a> but ended up turning into a <a href=\"/rules/combat\">Combat Situation</a> after the players repeatedly failed their <a href=\"/rules/skills\">Skill Checks</a> to befriend the wild pokemon. Meanwhile the players probably had to use their &lt;Skills> such as <a href=\"/traits/tracking\">[Tracking]</a> to find the girl, perhaps she was stuck in a cave whose entrance caved in requiring more Skill Checks to complete this Exploration Situation. </p>\n<p>At the end the players reach the Pokemon Center and completed the “Travel to Mt. Moon” scene. Surely that deserves some experience!</p>\n<h2>Venture</h2>\n<p>Meanwhile this scene was but a part of their overall Venture and goal, which is to: “Get to Cerulean City and beat Misty; the Cerulean City Gym Leader!”</p>\n<p>A <em>Venture</em> is a narrative tool similar to the Scene; but is different in a few distinct ways.</p>\n<p>Firstly a Venture is often associated with a goal that will likely take many IRL Play Sessions or at the very least a good few hours of session time to resolve. \nSecondly, a Venture should always move the narrative forward; this doesn’t mean you need to railroad your players of course, your players deciding they want to spend some time at the Game Corner grinding up the required coins for a Dratini is just as valid of a Venture even if it doesn’t move the plot forward in the way you the GM envisioned… But the players are still narratively moving forward!</p>\n<p>In a way, Ventures can be seen as a natural point for people who are used to running Milestone leveling, after all usually a Venture is only finished once some major goal has been concluded, be it successfully or not!</p>\n<h2>Experience Timings</h2>\n<p>GMs are free to choose whether they prefer handing out Experience during Scenes or Ventures; or even both!</p>\n<h3>Exclusively Scenes</h3>\n<p>When handing out experience exclusively in Scenes, you can follow the guidelines listed below to award experience as normal.</p>\n<h3>Exclusively Ventures</h3>\n<p>When handing out experience exclusively in Ventures, keep track of the amount of Scenes your players resolve and how they do; the base experience value will be equal to the regular base value for a Scene times the amount of Scenes your players have resolved. All Circumstance Modifiers will be added up together at the end.</p>\n<h3>Combination of Both</h3>\n<p>Possibly the most natural way to hand out experience is the combination of both; you hand out experience at the end of a Scene like normal. However, whenever a Scene would result in concluding a Venture you add an additional positive Circumstance Bonus for having finished the Venture.</p>\n<h2>Calculating Experience</h2>\n<p>Experience rewards rely on 2 key variables: The Base EXP Reward (BER) and the Circumstance Modifiers (CMs).</p>\n<p><strong><em>Base EXP Reward (BER)</em></strong>: This value is at 25% of the amount of XP needed to level up from the Average Player Level, rounded up. </p>\n<p>This value is 25% of the amount needed to go from the current average player level, to the next on the 'Slow' track, unless playing an exclusively Pokemon PC game, where you would use the 'Faster' track instead.  So f.e. At level 1 following the 'Slow' track, the BER is 2 XP, 253 XP at level 20, 1531 XP at level 50 and 3889 XP at level 80.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Circumstance Modifiers (CMs)</em></strong>: Circumstance Modifiers are modifiers to total exp earned for an encounter and are based on how players resolve Situations and how well they do so. The more ingenuitive the Player; and the better their results, the higher their CMs will be. However, did a plan fall through and end up in the gutter? It could result in some penalties to your total EXP earned… CMs are all cumulative stacked on-top of each other, meaning if you get a 10% bonus twice, the total bonus becomes 20%. You do not apply <code>BER * 1.1 * 1.1</code>.</p>\n<p>The effort of all the players are to be combined together in a single reward: whenever you award Experience, all Player Characters and up to 6 of their partners (assuming the standard six-Pokemon party) receive the calculated total (<code>BER * CM</code>).</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Alter this number based on the party size you enforce in your campaign. Consider allowing players to award Experience to Pokemon in their box.</em>\n  {.is-info}</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>What awards Experience?</h1>\n<p>So as I referenced a little earlier; realistically any type of situation can result in earning experience, listed below is a list of CMs a GM can choose to add to any given Scene or Venture to award or penalize the total EXP earned by the Party. Realistically there is no limit to how many modifiers you should give; just remember that if the modifier reaches 5 or higher that means your player’s their characters are guaranteed to get a Level-Up!</p>\n<h2>Circumstance Modifiers</h2>\n<p>The following sections depict all kinds of situations you may want to award experience; for your ease of use they’ve been separated in the following categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Combat</li>\n<li>Social</li>\n<li>Exploration</li>\n<li>Contests</li>\n<li>Pokeathlons</li>\n<li>\"Metagaming\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This doesn’t mean you should limit yourself to only awarding experience when these types of scenarios occur; <em>feel free to use the framework provided to create unique modifiers that make sense for the encounters ahead</em>! Some examples of this will be provided below as well.</p>\n<p>These following samples are also built with a “standard Pokemon journey” kept in mind; so it may refer to things like ‘evil Teams’.

So given the example of a bog standard “Beat the Gym Campaign” you probably want every venture to provide about 8-10 levels worth of experience, one for each Gym, perhaps one for teaching the local evil team a lesson, defeat the E4, and finally of course, win the championship!</p>\n<h2>Custom Modifier Example</h2>\n<p>One of your trainers is really focused on learning more about Fossils and using Fossil Pokemon; so you introduce a new Exploration Circumstance Modifier for “Finding Fossils in hard-to-find locations” worth +30%. Additionally, one of your trainers has been following a creative nicknaming convention for all their mons, whenever someone picks a creative, fun and or fitting nickname for a Pokemon upon capture: +20%.</p>\n<h1>EXP Math for Nerds</h1>\n<p>The EXP tracks we use are based on the video game ones, using the 'Slow' track for Trainers, and we have created our own 'Faster' track to use for Pokemon.</p>\n<p>This means that mathematically we can identify the experience curve as follows, where  <code>n = level</code>.</p>\n<h2>Trainers</h2>\n<p>$$\nEXP = \\frac{5n^3}{4}\n$$</p>\n<h2>Pokemon</h2>\n<p>$$\nEXP = \\frac{3n^3}{6}\n$$</p>",
        "markdown": "During your Journey in PTR2e one of the questions you’ll undoubtedly stumble upon will be: how are our levels set-up? \n\nWhile the full answer to this question is still up to debate; for now we have based level-ups around the Experience Tracks as they are in the Pokemon Mainline Video Games, where Humanoids follow the ‘Slow’ track while all Pokemon follow the ‘Faster’ track. The math for both you can [view below](#exp-math-for-nerds), but since you won't be plugging away into your calculator as the math is handled by Foundry, what is more important to know is:\n\n## Rules surrounding level-ups\nWhenever a character reaches an EXP Threshold they may immediately level-up; a GM might wish to delay a level-up until after a session or event occurs; but realistically due to the timing of when EXP is earned (more later) this shouldn’t be an issue.\n \nWhenever a level-up occurs, the following happens:\n- Gain +10 to spend amongst any of your Skills (except <Resources\\>)\n- Gain +1 Advancement Point, you may immediately spend this in the Perk Web or save it for later.\n  - This only triggers once every even level if you are a [Pokemon]\n  - Perks can only be purchased during level-up or while camping.\n  \nHowever, to be able to level-up we of course must also be able to earn EXP. There are many different types of activities that will award experience; be it from Combat, Exploration, Contests or even Pokeathlons. Realistically; if an activity is something that isn’t “guaranteed” to succeed; it’s worthy of earning experience.\n\nBut before we get into the exact details of the **\"how\"**; lets start of with the **\"when\"**.\n\n# When? Scenes & Ventures\nThe primary time to hand out experience will be at the end of any given Scene or Venture.\n\n## Scene\nA _Scene_ is a narrative tool of semi-indeterminate length within a certain context, which can consist of one or multiple Situations. An example of a Scene would be: “Traveling from Pewter City to Mt. Moon”. It’s a situation that likely will take many in-game hours, but it is likely unnecessary to actually spend many play-hours in the scene itself.\n\nAlong the road to Mt Moon your players may encounter some wild Pokemon, as well as help a lost kid find their way to the Pokemon Center, these Situations can be played out in many ways; the wild pokemon encounter may have started off as a Social situation during [Exploration Activities](/rules/exploration) but ended up turning into a [Combat Situation](/rules/combat) after the players repeatedly failed their [Skill Checks](/rules/skills) to befriend the wild pokemon. Meanwhile the players probably had to use their <Skills\\> such as [[Tracking]](/traits/tracking) to find the girl, perhaps she was stuck in a cave whose entrance caved in requiring more Skill Checks to complete this Exploration Situation. \n\nAt the end the players reach the Pokemon Center and completed the “Travel to Mt. Moon” scene. Surely that deserves some experience!\n\n## Venture\nMeanwhile this scene was but a part of their overall Venture and goal, which is to: “Get to Cerulean City and beat Misty; the Cerulean City Gym Leader!”\n\nA _Venture_ is a narrative tool similar to the Scene; but is different in a few distinct ways.\n\nFirstly a Venture is often associated with a goal that will likely take many IRL Play Sessions or at the very least a good few hours of session time to resolve. \nSecondly, a Venture should always move the narrative forward; this doesn’t mean you need to railroad your players of course, your players deciding they want to spend some time at the Game Corner grinding up the required coins for a Dratini is just as valid of a Venture even if it doesn’t move the plot forward in the way you the GM envisioned... But the players are still narratively moving forward!\n\nIn a way, Ventures can be seen as a natural point for people who are used to running Milestone leveling, after all usually a Venture is only finished once some major goal has been concluded, be it successfully or not!\n\n## Experience Timings\nGMs are free to choose whether they prefer handing out Experience during Scenes or Ventures; or even both!\n\n### Exclusively Scenes\nWhen handing out experience exclusively in Scenes, you can follow the guidelines listed below to award experience as normal.\n\n### Exclusively Ventures\nWhen handing out experience exclusively in Ventures, keep track of the amount of Scenes your players resolve and how they do; the base experience value will be equal to the regular base value for a Scene times the amount of Scenes your players have resolved. All Circumstance Modifiers will be added up together at the end.\n\n### Combination of Both\nPossibly the most natural way to hand out experience is the combination of both; you hand out experience at the end of a Scene like normal. However, whenever a Scene would result in concluding a Venture you add an additional positive Circumstance Bonus for having finished the Venture.\n\n## Calculating Experience\nExperience rewards rely on 2 key variables: The Base EXP Reward (BER) and the Circumstance Modifiers (CMs).\n\n___Base EXP Reward (BER)___: This value is at 25% of the amount of XP needed to level up from the Average Player Level, rounded up. \n\nThis value is 25% of the amount needed to go from the current average player level, to the next on the 'Slow' track, unless playing an exclusively Pokemon PC game, where you would use the 'Faster' track instead.  So f.e. At level 1 following the 'Slow' track, the BER is 2 XP, 253 XP at level 20, 1531 XP at level 50 and 3889 XP at level 80.\n\n___Circumstance Modifiers (CMs)___: Circumstance Modifiers are modifiers to total exp earned for an encounter and are based on how players resolve Situations and how well they do so. The more ingenuitive the Player; and the better their results, the higher their CMs will be. However, did a plan fall through and end up in the gutter? It could result in some penalties to your total EXP earned… CMs are all cumulative stacked on-top of each other, meaning if you get a 10% bonus twice, the total bonus becomes 20%. You do not apply `BER * 1.1 * 1.1`.\n\nThe effort of all the players are to be combined together in a single reward: whenever you award Experience, all Player Characters and up to 6 of their partners (assuming the standard six-Pokemon party) receive the calculated total (`BER * CM`).\n\n> *Alter this number based on the party size you enforce in your campaign. Consider allowing players to award Experience to Pokemon in their box.*\n{.is-info}\n\n# What awards Experience?\nSo as I referenced a little earlier; realistically any type of situation can result in earning experience, listed below is a list of CMs a GM can choose to add to any given Scene or Venture to award or penalize the total EXP earned by the Party. Realistically there is no limit to how many modifiers you should give; just remember that if the modifier reaches 5 or higher that means your player’s their characters are guaranteed to get a Level-Up!\n  \n## Circumstance Modifiers\nThe following sections depict all kinds of situations you may want to award experience; for your ease of use they’ve been separated in the following categories:\n- Combat\n- Social\n- Exploration\n- Contests\n- Pokeathlons\n- \"Metagaming\"\n\nThis doesn’t mean you should limit yourself to only awarding experience when these types of scenarios occur; _feel free to use the framework provided to create unique modifiers that make sense for the encounters ahead_! Some examples of this will be provided below as well.\n\nThese following samples are also built with a “standard Pokemon journey” kept in mind; so it may refer to things like ‘evil Teams’. Of course, in a Journey where you’re playing as evil Team members… you’d just have to invert the criteria.\n\n### Early Bonus\n- ___Baby's First Steps___: +100%\n  - If the Average Level that the Base EXP Reward was calculated from is less then 10, apply this bonus.

You can get around this by, say, nursing the fainted creature back to health, befriending it once it's awake, and capturing it properly.\n\n## Awarding the Appropriate Amount\nThe above should give you a good idea for what types of Circumstance Modifiers can be included when awarding experience; _you can use as many or as little of them as you want and heck; may even consider giving the same one multiple times when applicable_!\n\nAt the end of the day this is a framework that allows you to award experience appropriately; to properly balance your Journey you’ll want to consider the length of said Journey, at the end of the day from a progression perspective the goal will be to reach Level 100. So given the example of a bog standard “Beat the Gym Campaign” you probably want every venture to provide about 8-10 levels worth of experience, one for each Gym, perhaps one for teaching the local evil team a lesson, defeat the E4, and finally of course, win the championship!\n\n## Custom Modifier Example\nOne of your trainers is really focused on learning more about Fossils and using Fossil Pokemon; so you introduce a new Exploration Circumstance Modifier for “Finding Fossils in hard-to-find locations” worth +30%. Additionally, one of your trainers has been following a creative nicknaming convention for all their mons, whenever someone picks a creative, fun and or fitting nickname for a Pokemon upon capture: +20%.\n  \n# EXP Math for Nerds\nThe EXP tracks we use are based on the video game ones, using the 'Slow' track for Trainers, and we have created our own 'Faster' track to use for Pokemon.\n  \nThis means that mathematically we can identify the experience curve as follows, where  `n = level`.\n\n## Trainers\n$$\nEXP = \\frac{5n^3}{4}\n$$\n\n## Pokemon\n$$\nEXP = \\frac{3n^3}{6}\n$$",

        "content": "<p>In PTR:2E, items are simply called <strong>Gear</strong> and are expanded to cover any type of item imaginable. This includes not just the regular items from the video games, but also covers weapons and armor. Wherever Gear is mentioned, this means that any rules for Gear and Gearing up applies in all cases.</p>\n<h2>Gear Categories</h2>\n<p>All Gear is separated into the following Equip categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Held Items</em></strong> - Gear held in one or more hands, or appendages able to hold an item like a hand would. Weapons and some battle items fall under this category.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Worn Items</em></strong> - Gear that is worn over the body. Armor and some battle items fall under this category.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Accessory Items</em></strong> - Gear that can be attached to an area of the body, or in some cases, attached to other Gear (see Utility Jumpsuit for an example). Most battle items for Pokemon and some Trainer items fall under this category.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Belt Items</em></strong> - Gear that is equipped in the Belt Item Slot. Consumables such as Restoratives, PokeBalls and Food items fall under this category. Belt items equipped to the Belt Item Slot can have an amount equal to the items [Stack X] value in the same slot if applicable.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Stash Items</em></strong> - A subtype of Gear that may be equipped in the Stash Item Slot. Small, easy to use Consumables like berries are liable to also be Stash items. The Stash Slot may only hold one of an item at a time (rather than up to their full [Stack X] value).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For Crafting (see below) and general organization, gear is further separated into the following Item categories</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>PokeBall</em></strong> - your reliable Pokemon capture device</li>\n<li><strong><em>Weapon</em></strong> - Gear that is used for direct fighting. These items can have their own [Struggle] or [Fling] stats, as well as give access to an array of Weapon Attacks and other Typed Attacks depending on the item. Weapons can also have their own “PP Stock”, which can only be spent on the Moves the weapon gives access to, functioning like ammunition.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Equipment</em></strong> - Armor and Accessories fall under this category. Like Weapons, these can also give access to moves, and also can have a PP Stock to use those moves.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Restorative</em></strong> - Potions, Status cures and general medicine items.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Booster</em></strong> - X Items and Type boosters. These provide temporary or passive bonuses to various Stats or Attack Power.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Food</em></strong> - Berries and meals. These items have a variety of effects but mainly aid in recovering from Weary.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Evolution Item</em></strong> - Stones and Keepsakes. Mostly Rare quality items that aid in evolving Pokemon.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Ammo</em></strong> - [Fling] items that can be thrown or used by a Weapon. Can have a variety of effects besides causing direct damage.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Container</em></strong> - Backpacks, bags, pouches. These items allow you to carry your gear without any hassle. Optionally, container items can have limited storage space (like PMD).</li>\n<li><strong><em>Material</em></strong> - Mostly useless collections of material, like food scraps or metal slag, but notably may be used for the crafting of other items. See the “Collecting Materials” section for more details.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Other</em></strong> - Everything else. Usually involves items that have no direct battle application, but make up for it through utility.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Gearing Up - Equipment Use and Actions</h2>\n<p>Gearing up is a simple way to explain equipping items. Across an adventure, knowing what items to keep directly on your person and easily accessible can mean the difference between success and failure. Every creature gets a limited number of equipment <strong>Slots</strong>, and each piece of Gear can only be equipped to its respective slot.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Humans (and similar humanoids) have:<ul>\n<li><em>1 Held Slot</em></li>\n<li><em>1 Worn Slot</em></li>\n<li><em>1 Accessory Slot</em></li>\n<li><em>1 Stash Slot</em></li>\n<li><em>3 Belt Slots</em></li></ul></li>\n<li>Pokemon, other collectible species, or animals in general have:<ul>\n<li><em>1 Worn Slot</em></li>\n<li><em>1 Accessory Slot</em></li>\n<li><em>1 Stash Slot</em></li>\n<li><em>1 Belt Slot</em></li></ul></li>\n<li>The Player Characters (PCs) and [Ace] creatures also have:<ul>\n<li><em>1 Held Slot</em> (if they didn't have 1 already)</li>\n<li><em>2 Belt Slots</em> (if they didn't have 3 already)</li>\n<li><em>1 Backpack Slot</em>, to equip [Container] Gear</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The number of equipment slots a creature has can be altered by Traits, Abilities, Perks and sometimes other items (like a bandolier or backpack).</p>\n<h3>Gear Equipping Rules</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Only 1 of each type of gear can be equipped to their appropriate slot. In the case of Belt Slot items, they can be equipped up to that item's [Stack] value in a single slot.</li>\n<li><del>If a piece of Gear has more than one Slot listed, then it uses all of the listed slots. These items tend to have a combination of effects or give a larger bonus for taking up multiple slots.</del></li>\n<li>[Container] items are special in that having multiple container items does not take up additional equipment slot space in most cases. Container items simply add additional storage space without penalties, unless otherwise stated in the item’s traits or effect.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Gear Actions</h3>\n<p>Now that you’re geared up, how do you use items? Below are the following actions that allow you to use your items and generally interact with the world around you.</p>\n<h4>The \"Use\" Action</h4>\n<p>You may utilize an piece of Gear you have on your person or within your Physical Reach that you have access to. The Use Action changes depending on the item’s effect or location:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the item is equipped to your Belt Slot, you can retrieve and use the item with 1 Simple Action.</li>\n<li>If the item is currently stored in a container, the Use Action requires 1 Simple Action to open the container, and 1 Simple Action to retrieve and properly use the item.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Use action will make up a majority of actions for interacting and using items. This isn't limited to items alone and applies to objects in the environment as well, such as doors, buttons, levers, etc. Basically, if you have to manipulate something manually, it will require a Use action. In a combat scenario, you won't necessarily be able to use an item and attack on the same turn, and the Use action helps make this an easy distinction.</p>\n<p>Along with this, creatures that have an item used on them, like a Potion, doesn't cost their activations like in the video games. Only the user spends the action cost.</p>\n<h4>\"Draw\" and \"Store\"</h4>\n<p>You equip 1 Held item you have on your person or within your Physical Reach that you have access to, or store an equipped Held item in your Container or another slot if applicable. <del>At the start of combat you can use this action as a Free Action as long as you are not Flinched</del>.</p>\n<h4>\"Drop\"</h4>\n<p>You drop your currently equipped Held item on the space you are standing on as a Free Action. This frees up your Held Item Slot.</p>\n<h1>The Economy</h1>\n<p>PTR:2e uses cashless economy rules. This means that instead of direct cash rewards, character wealth is determined by Inventory Points (IP) and the <strong>Resources Skill</strong>. These represent a character’s ability to acquire goods and utilize services in a campaign.</p>\n<h2>Inventory Points (IP)</h2>\n<p><strong>Inventory Points</strong> or <strong>IP</strong>, is a meta-resource characters have to purchase items. The amount of IP a character has is determined by their Resources Skill with the following formula:\n$$\nIP = 12+\\frac{Resources_{Skill}}{10}\n$$</p>\n<p>IP is used in a couple of ways. The first is used to set a character's <strong>Loadout</strong>. When creating a Loadout, <strong>Common Rarity</strong> [Consumable] <del>and [Charge]</del> items are selected up to the character’s current <strong>Grade</strong>, subtracting IP equal to the IP cost of the items. <del>IP costs for items with the [Stack X] trait are for a single item in the stack. So if a character selects a stack of Potions, the total is 6 IP (2 per Potion)</del>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>IP Costs for Stacks needs to be refigured.\n  {.is-warning}</p>\n  <p>IP mechanics are still in flux.\n  {.is-warning}</p>\n  <p>For reference, a character’s Grade updates at the following levels<br />\n  Level 1 -&gt; Grade E<br />\n  Level 15 -&gt; Grade D<br />\n  Level 25 -&gt; Grade C<br />\n  Level 35 -&gt; Grade B<br />\n  Level 45 -&gt; Grade A</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The second thing IP is used for is to gain an item at a moment that it is needed, but the actor does not currently possess, utilizing the Use Action as a Complete Action as if they are drawing the item from a container. Any character that has any remaining IP can perform this Action in this way so long as they can justify why they would gain this item in the moment. <strong>Note: an item gained in this way during combat must be used within the same action, or else the item cannot be acquired.</strong></p>\n<p>Any items used from a Loadout will refund its IP cost during a <strong>Resupply Activity</strong>. This allows characters to top off or refresh any of their loadout items, or allow them to make changes in case of a change in IP totals. Characters can also choose to “sell” the items in their Loadout, resturning the IP back to their pool to spend on replacement/different items if they so desire. Any remaining IP not used by items from the Loadout is also refreshed during this activity. Resupply Activities can be done whenever the Players enter a settlement or zone that has markets or shops.</p>\n<p>Note: For GMs wishing to run scenarios with a greater emphasis on planning ahead, feel free to restrict IP to only being able to be spent to establish a load-out when in town. We recommend against removing it entirely or else you will find a lot of rolling for gear to deal with instead.</p>\n<h2>Item Availability</h2>\n<p>Items in the game use the following to determine availability: Grade and Rarity.</p>\n<p><strong>Grade</strong> refers to an item’s quality. The Item Grades are <strong>E, D, C, B, A, S, and S+</strong>, where E is the lowest quality, and S+ for the highest. Grade is not necessarily a measure of how strong an item is or how expensive it can be. Rather, it’s more abstract to denote the “cumulative value and significance” of an item beyond merely monetary value.</p>\n<p>Mechanically, Grade is intended to work as a scale of how easily a creature can gain the item and use it. This depends on your specific campaign setting, as the obtainability of higher grades could be tied to having more Badges in a traditional Gym Challenge or a higher Exploration Rank in a Mystery Dungeon game.</p>\n<p><strong>Rarity</strong> is the measure of general availability of an item. Item rarities are: <strong>Common, Uncommon, Rare, and Unique</strong>. Commonly, higher Grade items are often higher Rarity in many traditional settings. But Rare or Unique items that are higher-tech or magical in a normal setting would probably be Common or Uncommon in cyberpunk or high fantasy settings.</p>\n<p>On a basic level, Grade and Rarity is used to determine the stock of shops in settlements, or loot in dungeons. The listed, out-of-the-box values for these items are considered the “defaults” for the most common Pokemon settings: that of the mainline video games. Because of this, an Item’s Grade and Rarity, more than any of their other stats, are the two values we recommend GMs look into revising to fit for their own setting.</p>\n<h2>Shopping</h2>\n<p><strong>Shopping</strong> is an Extended Downtime Action that takes one Daytime Span to complete. When in a place that has shops, share with your players the number and types of shops available. During this Span, players can shop at one or all locations provided to them.</p>\n<p>Whenever anyone in the party wishes to participate in the Shopping Activity, the party rolls a Resources Skill Check for each item they wish to obtain, using a DC modified by the Item Grade and Rarity, and the Resource Skill of the player of their choice. Players can roll for any Items within reason. Refer to the following modifiers to determine difficulty of the roll:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Players rolling for an item above their Grade have a <strong>-10 penalty to the DC per higher Grade</strong>.</li>\n<li>Players rolling for an item below their Grade get a <strong>+10 bonus to the DC</strong>.</li>\n<li>Item Rarity affects the roll as follows:<br /><ul>\n<li><strong>Common: +20</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Uncommon: +0</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Rare: -20</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Unique: -40</strong> (<em>some of these items may require additional GM permission to pursue</em>)</li></ul></li>\n<li>Players rolling a <strong>[Stack X]</strong> have a <strong>-20 penalty to the DC</strong>.</li>\n<li>The Player rolling Resources may spend their <em>Luck</em> to improve the result of their roll.</li>\n<li>Any Player (not just the one whose Resources Skill is being used to roll) may spend <em>Resources</em> to improve the result of their or any ally's roll.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the DC of a roll ends up being 100 or more, the DC is set to 100 and the player is considered to have +1 DoS on the roll. If the DC falls to below 0 the item cannot be rolled for.</p>\n<p>On a success, the party gains the item in question, and on a failure, they fail to obtain the item. Getting a certain number of additional DoSs allows you to get more of the item in question. This number of DoS is equal to the item's Grade (E is 1, S+ is 7) of DoS on the roll. So if you pursue an Escape Orb in a Mystery Dungeon game, you need to get +3 additional DoS beyond the first to get another Escape Orb, +6 additional to get 2 more, etc.</p>\n<p>For items with a [Stack X] Trait, this is somewhat different. The player gains 1 full Stack of that item. For every DoS (beyond the first) <em>and</em> DoF, you gain or lose 1 item from the purchased amount, meaning that you still get some of the Stack on 1 DoF, but will end up with nothing if the failure is too severe.</p>\n<p>On a failure, the Party cannot roll for that item again until the next time the shop Restocks.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Note</strong>: The above does in fact mean that a party can roll multiple times for a given item type. However, GMs may choose to close off the supply of the item at any time they wish before the party fails on of the Shopping Rolls for that item.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As an example, let's say that a Level 1 player with Resources 40 wants to have more Basic Balls than their Loadout provides. They are in a settlement with a PokeMart. They take part in Shopping, consuming a Daytime Span. The Player rolls a DC 40 check (<code>40</code> Resources <code>+ 0</code> Grade mod <code>+ 20</code> Rarity mod <code>-20</code> Stack mod). They roll a 60, 3 DoF. This means they gain 2 Basic Balls rather than the normal Stack of 5, and the party cannot try for more Basic Balls during this Shopping activity.</p>\n<p>While they are there, they also try for Great Balls, which is 2 Grades above their Rank. They roll a d100 against a DC 20 (<code>40</code> Resources <code>- 20</code> Grade mod <code>+ 20</code> Rarity mod <code>-20</code> Stack mod) and roll a 5, 2 DoS. They end up getting 7 Great Balls out of it.</p>\n<p>For the examples above, the first player could spend 20 Resources to ensure they can get 5 Basic Balls, a full Stack, and allow the party to roll for more Basic Balls. As well, the second player could spend 5 to ensure they get another Great Ball, or 15 to get 2 more, etc.</p>\n<p>While the Shopping Activity is the easiest way for your players to get items they want, it is not without limitations. Shops need to Restock items periodically and rotate their inventory. Because of this, the Shopping Activity is limited to 1 use per Settlement and recharges after the settlement Restocks, usually taking 1 in-game week or when circumstances change according to the GM.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>GM Note: Players can realistically roll for every single item in the game at the right shops. While there is no specific rule to prevent that, it is a good idea to limit these rolls as needed. Also feel free to tell them \"no\" if they even attempt that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Thrifting</h3>\n<p><strong>Thrifting</strong> functions much in the spirit of <em>Push Your Luck</em> and <em>Devil's Deal</em>. The Party can decide to pursue an additional amount of an item (<code>+X</code> more Stacks, <code>+X</code> more individual items). The GM decides a fitting penalty to the roll's DC (<em>consider higher penalties for rarer items, higher quality items, or greater quanities being pursued</em>), and the Party makes the Shopping Roll.</p>\n<p>On success, the standard effects apply, except the base amount of items purchased increases by <code>+X</code> / <code>+X</code> Stacks.</p>\n<p>On failure, the standard effects still apply and the Party loses <code>2*X</code> Resources per DoF.</p>\n<h3>Bartering</h3>\n<p>As part of a Shopping Roll, a Player can choose to sell one item (or a full Stack of an item) to gain a DC bonus on that roll. This bonus is is based on the Item's Rarity (which can be influenced by location here, as Rarity may always be), equal to <code>+5 * Item Rarity</code> (Common is 1, Unique is 4).</p>\n<h2>Increasing Resource Skill</h2>\n<p>The Resource skill is vital to a player’s ability to gain items and favors. The first way the Resource Skill can be manipulated is by winning battles and completing Quests (just going with this for now until we decide progression stuff). For each of the following factors, the players gain a permanent increase to their Resource Skill:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Winning a Battle vs other Trainers (or Exploration Teams): <strong>+1</strong></li>\n<li>Defeating a Rich opponent: <strong>+3</strong></li>\n<li>Defeating a Boss: <strong>+5</strong></li>\n<li>Completing a Quest: <strong>+1 to +10</strong></li>\n<li>Pawning: <strong>+1 to +12</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, failing the above factors will result in a permanent decrease to the players Resource skill. The Resource skill cannot be increased above 90 or decreased below 10.</p>\n<p>The second way to manipulate the resource skill is by using Treasure items, such as the Nugget. Treasure items are consumables that give a one time bonus to any Resource skill roll. Each treasure item lists the bonus it grants.</p>\n<h3>Pawning</h3>\n<p>Tied together with Shopping, <strong>Pawning</strong> is also included as a Downtime Action that happens parallel to Shopping. When in a place that has fences or anyone willing to take your goods, share with your players the number and types of available. During this Span, each Player can choose to sell 1 Item or 1 Stack of Items to a fence.</p>\n<p>However, fences are sly, able to tell if an affluent customer is trying to sell them their junk. Trying to sell Gear that is a lower Grade than the Player makes it harder to earn Resources from Pawning.</p>\n<p>If a Player does decide to sell one of their Items through Pawning, they gain Resources equal to <code>1 + (4*Rarity + 3*Grade) / 3 - deltaGrade</code>, rounded down, where <code>deltaGrade</code> is <code>userGrade-itemGrade+1</code>, minimum 0.</p>\n<p>This means that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A Grade E Trainer selling a Stack of Basic Balls earns 1 Resource</li>\n<li>A Grade C Trainer selling a Stack of Great Balls earns 3 Resources</li>\n<li>A Grade C Trainer selling a Stack of Basic Balls earns 1 Resource</li>\n<li>A Grade A Trainer selling a Stack of Great Balls earns 1 Resource</li>\n<li>A Grade A Trainer selling a Soul Dew earns 8 Resources</li>\n<li>A Grade B Trainer selling a Soul Dew earns 9 Resources</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Crafting and Other Acquisition Means</h1>\n<p>Crafting is another way for players to obtain items. When crafting items, the players will need the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The correct amount of materials.</li>\n<li>The recipe of the item they wish to craft.</li>\n<li>The right tools on hand.</li>\n<li>Enough time to complete a crafting project.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Collecting Materials</h2>\n<p>The first thing a crafter needs to get familiar with is the materials to craft items. Materials are separated into two categories: Generic Materials and Specific Materials.</p>\n<p>Generic Materials are as the name implies: these are highly abundant crafting resources that are commonly used across items in a single category. Can be identified on the item list under Materials as they all have a [Stack X] value and have the trait [Material]. When used in crafting, a higher number of these items is needed the higher the Grade the item is.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(We’ll need to determine how we want to handle the Generic Materials. It may be best to have Generic Materials for every Item type. We’ll probably tie that to a Trait, and have the value in the Category column also be read as a separate Trait.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Specific Materials are a bit of the opposite. Unlike Generic Materials, these do not have a [Stack X] value and can only be acquired if they are readily available around where the players are. Specific Materials are also on roll tables, such as the Apricorn table as an example.</p>\n<p>For players to find crafting materials, they can perform a Gather Material Activity.</p>\n<h3>Gather Materials - Camp Activity</h3>\n<p>The players roll an appropriate skill, or their Resource skill, to locate crafting materials in the area they are in, or an area that is close by. When rolling, they declare the item they are looking for materials to craft and apply the following modifiers based on the item's scarcity in the relative area:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Example situational modifiers</em>:<ul>\n<li>Searching for berries in a drought confers a <strong>-20 bonus to the DC</strong>.</li>\n<li>Searching around an area that is difficult for you to traverse confers a <strong>-20 bonus to the DC</strong>.</li>\n<li>Searching around your hometown confers a <strong>+10 bonus to the DC</strong>.</li></ul></li>\n<li>Material Item Rarity Modifiers<ul>\n<li><strong>Common: +15</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Uncommon: -10</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Rare: -35</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Unique: -60</strong> (<em>if a GM feels than an item is absolutely unable to be searched for in an area, they can say it is not able to searched for</em>)</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<p>On a success, the players gain 1 Stack of the Generic Material and 1 of the Specific Material. You get +1 Specific Material per each additional DoS, and +1 Stack of Generic Material per additional 2 DoS.</p>\n<p>If the DC of a roll ends up being 100 or more, the DC is set to 100 and the player is considered to have +1 DoS on the roll. If the DC falls to below 0 the item cannot be rolled for.</p>\n<h2>Item Recipes</h2>\n<p>The second piece for crafting is a <strong>Recipe</strong>. Recipes are items that are not typically found in shops. These usually need to be acquired from someone that knows the recipe, or found through other means such as from a <strong>Crafting Manual</strong>. During a Shopping Activity, a player can inquire if there is a teacher or another location that may have recipes to learn on hand. If there is, they roll the Crafting Skill listed on the recipe using the same modifiers for recipe Grade and Rarity as if they were Shopping, and may use Resources and Luck as with Shopping. <strong>As a rule, Recipes are always 2 Grades and 1 Rarity higher than the item they are associated with</strong>.</p>\n<p>On a success, the player gains and learns the recipe, adding it to their own Crafting Manual. For recipes found as loot, a player can spend 1 Downtime Activity to add the recipe to their manual by succeeding on an Hard Skill Check with the listed Crafting Skill.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Still in development, subject to change.\n  {.is-warning}</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Crafting Projects</h2>\n<p>Now that a player knows the correct recipe and has the correct number of materials, they can attempt to craft the item. Crafting is a time consuming process that needs total focus to complete.</p>\n<p>When a player wishes to conduct the <strong>Craft Activity</strong>, determine first if they are in an area that allows them time to craft (at least 1 Daytime Span). If the player has enough time, next determine if they have access to the correct tools for crafting the item. Shops and PokeCenters might have crafting stations for your players to use. Otherwise, they will need the correct Tool item in their inventory, such as the PokeBall Maintenance kit.</p>\n<p>When a player begins a <strong>Crafting Project</strong>, the GM creates a <strong>Project Clock</strong> with a number of Spans equal to the Item's Craft Time value.</p>\n<h3>Craft Activity - Camp Activity</h3>\n<p>Choose an item you desire to craft and roll the listed crafting Skill using the following modifiers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Example situational modifiers</em>:<ul>\n<li>Using a crafting station or tools you do not own confers a <strong>-10 bonus to the DC</strong>.</li>\n<li>Working in a quiet area confers a <strong>+10 bonus to the DC</strong>.</li>\n<li>Utilzing a high-end workspace that makes it substantially easier/faster for you to craft confers a <strong>+30 bonus to the DC</strong>.</li></ul></li>\n<li>Crafting an item above one's grade Grade confers a <strong>-10 penalty to the DC per higher Grade</strong>.</li>\n<li>Crafting an item below one's grade Grade confers a <strong>+10 bonus to the DC</strong>.</li>\n<li>The crafting Player may spend <em>Resources</em> to improve the result of the roll.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On a success, you fill in 1 Span of the item’s Project Clock, plus 1 additional Span for every 3 DoS. On a failure, you empty 1 Span of the Project Clock, and with 3+ DoF, the Clock increases in size by 1 Span, up to the a maximum of double the Item's Craft Time value.</p>\n<p>When the Project Clock is filled, you spend the listed materials, crafting 1 of that item (or one Stack's worth, for [Stack X] items).</p>\n<p>For [Stack X] items, you craft 1 additional item for each DoS on the crafting roll that completed the Crafting Project. For non-consumable items, you craft one of that item, plus another per additional Grade's worth (E is 1, S+ is 7) of DoS on the roll (if you were crafting a Focus Band, a Grade C Accessory, and you get 5 DoS on the final roll, you end up crafting 2 Focus Bands, since you get an additional one at 4 DoS, 7 DoS, etc.).</p>",
        "markdown": "In PTR:2E, items are simply called **Gear** and are expanded to cover any type of item imaginable. This includes not just the regular items from the video games, but also covers weapons and armor. Wherever Gear is mentioned, this means that any rules for Gear and Gearing up applies in all cases.\n\n## Gear Categories\n\nAll Gear is separated into the following Equip categories:\n\n-   ___Held Items___ - Gear held in one or more hands, or appendages able to hold an item like a hand would. Weapons and some battle items fall under this category.\n-   ___Worn Items___ - Gear that is worn over the body. Armor and some battle items fall under this category.\n-   ___Accessory Items___ - Gear that can be attached to an area of the body, or in some cases, attached to other Gear (see Utility Jumpsuit for an example). Most battle items for Pokemon and some Trainer items fall under this category.\n-   ___Belt Items___ - Gear that is equipped in the Belt Item Slot. Consumables such as Restoratives, PokeBalls and Food items fall under this category. Belt items equipped to the Belt Item Slot can have an amount equal to the items \\[Stack X\\] value in the same slot if applicable.\n-   ___Stash Items___ - A subtype of Gear that may be equipped in the Stash Item Slot. Small, easy to use Consumables like berries are liable to also be Stash items. The Stash Slot may only hold one of an item at a time (rather than up to their full \\[Stack X\\] value).\n\nFor Crafting (see below) and general organization, gear is further separated into the following Item categories\n\n-   ___PokeBall___ - your reliable Pokemon capture device\n-   ___Weapon___ - Gear that is used for direct fighting. These items can have their own \\[Struggle\\] or \\[Fling\\] stats, as well as give access to an array of Weapon Attacks and other Typed Attacks depending on the item. Weapons can also have their own “PP Stock”, which can only be spent on the Moves the weapon gives access to, functioning like ammunition.\n-   ___Equipment___ - Armor and Accessories fall under this category. Like Weapons, these can also give access to moves, and also can have a PP Stock to use those moves.\n-   ___Restorative___ - Potions, Status cures and general medicine items.\n-   ___Booster___ - X Items and Type boosters. These provide temporary or passive bonuses to various Stats or Attack Power.\n-   ___Food___ - Berries and meals. These items have a variety of effects but mainly aid in recovering from Weary.\n-   ___Evolution Item___ - Stones and Keepsakes. Mostly Rare quality items that aid in evolving Pokemon.\n-   ___Ammo___ - \\[Fling\\] items that can be thrown or used by a Weapon. Can have a variety of effects besides causing direct damage.\n-   ___Container___ - Backpacks, bags, pouches. These items allow you to carry your gear without any hassle. Optionally, container items can have limited storage space (like PMD).\n-   ___Material___ - Mostly useless collections of material, like food scraps or metal slag, but notably may be used for the crafting of other items. See the “Collecting Materials” section for more details.\n-   ___Other___ - Everything else. Usually involves items that have no direct battle application, but make up for it through utility.\n\n## Gearing Up - Equipment Use and Actions\n\nGearing up is a simple way to explain equipping items. Across an adventure, knowing what items to keep directly on your person and easily accessible can mean the difference between success and failure. Every creature gets a limited number of equipment **Slots**, and each piece of Gear can only be equipped to its respective slot.\n\n- Humans (and similar humanoids) have:\n  - _1 Held Slot_\n  - _1 Worn Slot_\n  - _1 Accessory Slot_\n  - _1 Stash Slot_\n  - _3 Belt Slots_\n- Pokemon, other collectible species, or animals in general have:\n  - _1 Worn Slot_\n  - _1 Accessory Slot_\n  - _1 Stash Slot_\n  - _1 Belt Slot_\n- The Player Characters (PCs) and \\[Ace] creatures also have:\n  - _1 Held Slot_ (if they didn't have 1 already)\n  - _2 Belt Slots_ (if they didn't have 3 already)\n  - _1 Backpack Slot_, to equip \\[Container] Gear\n\nThe number of equipment slots a creature has can be altered by Traits, Abilities, Perks and sometimes other items (like a bandolier or backpack).\n\n### Gear Equipping Rules\n\n- Only 1 of each type of gear can be equipped to their appropriate slot. In the case of Belt Slot items, they can be equipped up to that item's \\[Stack\\] value in a single slot.\n- ~~If a piece of Gear has more than one Slot listed, then it uses all of the listed slots. These items tend to have a combination of effects or give a larger bonus for taking up multiple slots.~~\n- \\[Container] items are special in that having multiple container items does not take up additional equipment slot space in most cases. Container items simply add additional storage space without penalties, unless otherwise stated in the item’s traits or effect.\n\n### Gear Actions\n\nNow that you’re geared up, how do you use items? Below are the following actions that allow you to use your items and generally interact with the world around you.\n\n#### The \"Use\" Action\n\nYou may utilize an piece of Gear you have on your person or within your Physical Reach that you have access to. The Use Action changes depending on the item’s effect or location:\n\n-   If the item is equipped to your Belt Slot, you can retrieve and use the item with 1 Simple Action.\n-   If the item is currently stored in a container, the Use Action requires 1 Simple Action to open the container, and 1 Simple Action to retrieve and properly use the item.\n\nThe Use action will make up a majority of actions for interacting and using items. This isn't limited to items alone and applies to objects in the environment as well, such as doors, buttons, levers, etc. Basically, if you have to manipulate something manually, it will require a Use action. In a combat scenario, you won't necessarily be able to use an item and attack on the same turn, and the Use action helps make this an easy distinction.\n\nAlong with this, creatures that have an item used on them, like a Potion, doesn't cost their activations like in the video games. Only the user spends the action cost.\n\n#### \"Draw\" and \"Store\"\n\nYou equip 1 Held item you have on your person or within your Physical Reach that you have access to, or store an equipped Held item in your Container or another slot if applicable. ~~At the start of combat you can use this action as a Free Action as long as you are not Flinched~~.\n\n#### \"Drop\"\n\nYou drop your currently equipped Held item on the space you are standing on as a Free Action. This frees up your Held Item Slot.\n\n# The Economy\n\nPTR:2e uses cashless economy rules. This means that instead of direct cash rewards, character wealth is determined by Inventory Points (IP) and the **Resources Skill**. These represent a character’s ability to acquire goods and utilize services in a campaign.\n\n## Inventory Points (IP)\n\n**Inventory Points** or **IP**, is a meta-resource characters have to purchase items. The amount of IP a character has is determined by their Resources Skill with the following formula:\n$$\nIP = 12+\\frac{Resources_{Skill}}{10}\n$$\n\nIP is used in a couple of ways. The first is used to set a character's **Loadout**. When creating a Loadout, **Common Rarity** \\[Consumable\\] ~~and \\[Charge\\]~~ items are selected up to the character’s current **Grade**, subtracting IP equal to the IP cost of the items. ~~IP costs for items with the \\[Stack X\\] trait are for a single item in the stack. So if a character selects a stack of Potions, the total is 6 IP (2 per Potion)~~.\n\n> IP Costs for Stacks needs to be refigured.\n{.is-warning}\n\n> IP mechanics are still in flux.\n{.is-warning}\n\n\n> For reference, a character’s Grade updates at the following levels  \n> Level 1 -> Grade E  \n> Level 15 -> Grade D  \n> Level 25 -> Grade C  \n> Level 35 -> Grade B  \n> Level 45 -> Grade A\n\nThe second thing IP is used for is to gain an item at a moment that it is needed, but the actor does not currently possess, utilizing the Use Action as a Complete Action as if they are drawing the item from a container. Any character that has any remaining IP can perform this Action in this way so long as they can justify why they would gain this item in the moment. **Note: an item gained in this way during combat must be used within the same action, or else the item cannot be acquired.**\n\nAny items used from a Loadout will refund its IP cost during a **Resupply Activity**. This allows characters to top off or refresh any of their loadout items, or allow them to make changes in case of a change in IP totals. Characters can also choose to “sell” the items in their Loadout, resturning the IP back to their pool to spend on replacement/different items if they so desire. Any remaining IP not used by items from the Loadout is also refreshed during this activity. Resupply Activities can be done whenever the Players enter a settlement or zone that has markets or shops.\n\nNote: For GMs wishing to run scenarios with a greater emphasis on planning ahead, feel free to restrict IP to only being able to be spent to establish a load-out when in town. We recommend against removing it entirely or else you will find a lot of rolling for gear to deal with instead.\n\n## Item Availability\n\nItems in the game use the following to determine availability: Grade and Rarity.\n\n**Grade** refers to an item’s quality. The Item Grades are **E, D, C, B, A, S, and S+**, where E is the lowest quality, and S+ for the highest. Grade is not necessarily a measure of how strong an item is or how expensive it can be. Rather, it’s more abstract to denote the “cumulative value and significance” of an item beyond merely monetary value.\n\nMechanically, Grade is intended to work as a scale of how easily a creature can gain the item and use it. This depends on your specific campaign setting, as the obtainability of higher grades could be tied to having more Badges in a traditional Gym Challenge or a higher Exploration Rank in a Mystery Dungeon game.\n\n**Rarity** is the measure of general availability of an item. Item rarities are: **Common, Uncommon, Rare, and Unique**. Commonly, higher Grade items are often higher Rarity in many traditional settings. But Rare or Unique items that are higher-tech or magical in a normal setting would probably be Common or Uncommon in cyberpunk or high fantasy settings.\n\nOn a basic level, Grade and Rarity is used to determine the stock of shops in settlements, or loot in dungeons. The listed, out-of-the-box values for these items are considered the “defaults” for the most common Pokemon settings: that of the mainline video games. Because of this, an Item’s Grade and Rarity, more than any of their other stats, are the two values we recommend GMs look into revising to fit for their own setting.\n\n## Shopping\n**Shopping** is an Extended Downtime Action that takes one Daytime Span to complete. When in a place that has shops, share with your players the number and types of shops available. During this Span, players can shop at one or all locations provided to them.\n\nWhenever anyone in the party wishes to participate in the Shopping Activity, the party rolls a Resources Skill Check for each item they wish to obtain, using a DC modified by the Item Grade and Rarity, and the Resource Skill of the player of their choice. Players can roll for any Items within reason. Refer to the following modifiers to determine difficulty of the roll:\n\n- Players rolling for an item above their Grade have a **-10 penalty to the DC per higher Grade**.\n- Players rolling for an item below their Grade get a **+10 bonus to the DC**.\n- Item Rarity affects the roll as follows:  \n  - **Common: +20**\n  - **Uncommon: +0**\n  - **Rare: -20**\n  - **Unique: -40** (*some of these items may require additional GM permission to pursue*)\n- Players rolling a **\\[Stack X]** have a **-20 penalty to the DC**.\n- The Player rolling Resources may spend their _Luck_ to improve the result of their roll.\n- Any Player (not just the one whose Resources Skill is being used to roll) may spend _Resources_ to improve the result of their or any ally's roll.\n\nIf the DC of a roll ends up being 100 or more, the DC is set to 100 and the player is considered to have +1 DoS on the roll. If the DC falls to below 0 the item cannot be rolled for.\n\nOn a success, the party gains the item in question, and on a failure, they fail to obtain the item. Getting a certain number of additional DoSs allows you to get more of the item in question. This number of DoS is equal to the item's Grade (E is 1, S+ is 7) of DoS on the roll. So if you pursue an Escape Orb in a Mystery Dungeon game, you need to get +3 additional DoS beyond the first to get another Escape Orb, +6 additional to get 2 more, etc.\n\nFor items with a \\[Stack X\\] Trait, this is somewhat different. The player gains 1 full Stack of that item. For every DoS (beyond the first) _and_ DoF, you gain or lose 1 item from the purchased amount, meaning that you still get some of the Stack on 1 DoF, but will end up with nothing if the failure is too severe.\n\nOn a failure, the Party cannot roll for that item again until the next time the shop Restocks.\n\n> **Note**: The above does in fact mean that a party can roll multiple times for a given item type. However, GMs may choose to close off the supply of the item at any time they wish before the party fails on of the Shopping Rolls for that item.\n\nAs an example, let's say that a Level 1 player with Resources 40 wants to have more Basic Balls than their Loadout provides. They are in a settlement with a PokeMart. They take part in Shopping, consuming a Daytime Span. The Player rolls a DC 40 check (`40` Resources `+ 0` Grade mod `+ 20` Rarity mod `-20` Stack mod). They roll a 60, 3 DoF. This means they gain 2 Basic Balls rather than the normal Stack of 5, and the party cannot try for more Basic Balls during this Shopping activity.\n\nWhile they are there, they also try for Great Balls, which is 2 Grades above their Rank. They roll a d100 against a DC 20 (`40` Resources `- 20` Grade mod `+ 20` Rarity mod `-20` Stack mod) and roll a 5, 2 DoS. They end up getting 7 Great Balls out of it.\n\nFor the examples above, the first player could spend 20 Resources to ensure they can get 5 Basic Balls, a full Stack, and allow the party to roll for more Basic Balls. As well, the second player could spend 5 to ensure they get another Great Ball, or 15 to get 2 more, etc.\n\nWhile the Shopping Activity is the easiest way for your players to get items they want, it is not without limitations. Shops need to Restock items periodically and rotate their inventory. Because of this, the Shopping Activity is limited to 1 use per Settlement and recharges after the settlement Restocks, usually taking 1 in-game week or when circumstances change according to the GM.\n\n> GM Note: Players can realistically roll for every single item in the game at the right shops. While there is no specific rule to prevent that, it is a good idea to limit these rolls as needed. Also feel free to tell them \"no\" if they even attempt that.\n\n### Thrifting\n**Thrifting** functions much in the spirit of *Push Your Luck* and *Devil's Deal*. The Party can decide to pursue an additional amount of an item (`+X` more Stacks, `+X` more individual items). The GM decides a fitting penalty to the roll's DC (_consider higher penalties for rarer items, higher quality items, or greater quanities being pursued_), and the Party makes the Shopping Roll.\n\nOn success, the standard effects apply, except the base amount of items purchased increases by `+X` / `+X` Stacks.\n\nOn failure, the standard effects still apply and the Party loses `2*X` Resources per DoF.\n\n### Bartering\nAs part of a Shopping Roll, a Player can choose to sell one item (or a full Stack of an item) to gain a DC bonus on that roll. This bonus is is based on the Item's Rarity (which can be influenced by location here, as Rarity may always be), equal to `+5 * Item Rarity` (Common is 1, Unique is 4).\n\n## Increasing Resource Skill\n\nThe Resource skill is vital to a player’s ability to gain items and favors. The first way the Resource Skill can be manipulated is by winning battles and completing Quests (just going with this for now until we decide progression stuff). For each of the following factors, the players gain a permanent increase to their Resource Skill:\n\n- Winning a Battle vs other Trainers (or Exploration Teams): **+1**\n- Defeating a Rich opponent: **+3**\n- Defeating a Boss: **+5**\n- Completing a Quest: **+1 to +10**\n- Pawning: **+1 to +12**\n\nHowever, failing the above factors will result in a permanent decrease to the players Resource skill. The Resource skill cannot be increased above 90 or decreased below 10.\n\nThe second way to manipulate the resource skill is by using Treasure items, such as the Nugget. Treasure items are consumables that give a one time bonus to any Resource skill roll. Each treasure item lists the bonus it grants.\n\n### Pawning\nTied together with Shopping, **Pawning** is also included as a Downtime Action that happens parallel to Shopping. When in a place that has fences or anyone willing to take your goods, share with your players the number and types of available. During this Span, each Player can choose to sell 1 Item or 1 Stack of Items to a fence.\n\nHowever, fences are sly, able to tell if an affluent customer is trying to sell them their junk. Trying to sell Gear that is a lower Grade than the Player makes it harder to earn Resources from Pawning.\n\nIf a Player does decide to sell one of their Items through Pawning, they gain Resources equal to `1 + (4*Rarity + 3*Grade) / 3 - deltaGrade`, rounded down, where `deltaGrade` is `userGrade-itemGrade+1`, minimum 0.\n\nThis means that:\n1. A Grade E Trainer selling a Stack of Basic Balls earns 1 Resource\n1. A Grade C Trainer selling a Stack of Great Balls earns 3 Resources\n1. A Grade C Trainer selling a Stack of Basic Balls earns 1 Resource\n1. A Grade A Trainer selling a Stack of Great Balls earns 1 Resource\n1. A Grade A Trainer selling a Soul Dew earns 8 Resources\n1. A Grade B Trainer selling a Soul Dew earns 9 Resources\n\n# Crafting and Other Acquisition Means\n\nCrafting is another way for players to obtain items. When crafting items, the players will need the following:\n\n-   The correct amount of materials.\n-   The recipe of the item they wish to craft.\n-   The right tools on hand.\n-   Enough time to complete a crafting project.\n\n## Collecting Materials\n\nThe first thing a crafter needs to get familiar with is the materials to craft items. Materials are separated into two categories: Generic Materials and Specific Materials.\n\nGeneric Materials are as the name implies: these are highly abundant crafting resources that are commonly used across items in a single category. Can be identified on the item list under Materials as they all have a \\[Stack X\\] value and have the trait \\[Material]. When used in crafting, a higher number of these items is needed the higher the Grade the item is.\n\n> (We’ll need to determine how we want to handle the Generic Materials. It may be best to have Generic Materials for every Item type. We’ll probably tie that to a Trait, and have the value in the Category column also be read as a separate Trait.)\n\nSpecific Materials are a bit of the opposite. Unlike Generic Materials, these do not have a \\[Stack X\\] value and can only be acquired if they are readily available around where the players are. Specific Materials are also on roll tables, such as the Apricorn table as an example.\n\nFor players to find crafting materials, they can perform a Gather Material Activity.\n\n### Gather Materials - Camp Activity  \nThe players roll an appropriate skill, or their Resource skill, to locate crafting materials in the area they are in, or an area that is close by. When rolling, they declare the item they are looking for materials to craft and apply the following modifiers based on the item's scarcity in the relative area:\n\n- _Example situational modifiers_:\n  - Searching for berries in a drought confers a **-20 bonus to the DC**.\n  - Searching around an area that is difficult for you to traverse confers a **-20 bonus to the DC**.\n  - Searching around your hometown confers a **+10 bonus to the DC**.\n- Material Item Rarity Modifiers\n  - **Common: +15**\n  - **Uncommon: -10**\n  - **Rare: -35**\n  - **Unique: -60** (*if a GM feels than an item is absolutely unable to be searched for in an area, they can say it is not able to searched for*)\n\nOn a success, the players gain 1 Stack of the Generic Material and 1 of the Specific Material. You get +1 Specific Material per each additional DoS, and +1 Stack of Generic Material per additional 2 DoS.\n\nIf the DC of a roll ends up being 100 or more, the DC is set to 100 and the player is considered to have +1 DoS on the roll. If the DC falls to below 0 the item cannot be rolled for.\n\n## Item Recipes\n\nThe second piece for crafting is a **Recipe**. Recipes are items that are not typically found in shops. These usually need to be acquired from someone that knows the recipe, or found through other means such as from a **Crafting Manual**. During a Shopping Activity, a player can inquire if there is a teacher or another location that may have recipes to learn on hand. If there is, they roll the Crafting Skill listed on the recipe using the same modifiers for recipe Grade and Rarity as if they were Shopping, and may use Resources and Luck as with Shopping. **As a rule, Recipes are always 2 Grades and 1 Rarity higher than the item they are associated with**.\n\nOn a success, the player gains and learns the recipe, adding it to their own Crafting Manual. For recipes found as loot, a player can spend 1 Downtime Activity to add the recipe to their manual by succeeding on an Hard Skill Check with the listed Crafting Skill.\n\n> Still in development, subject to change.\n{.is-warning}\n\n## Crafting Projects\n\nNow that a player knows the correct recipe and has the correct number of materials, they can attempt to craft the item. Crafting is a time consuming process that needs total focus to complete.\n\nWhen a player wishes to conduct the **Craft Activity**, determine first if they are in an area that allows them time to craft (at least 1 Daytime Span). If the player has enough time, next determine if they have access to the correct tools for crafting the item. Shops and PokeCenters might have crafting stations for your players to use. Otherwise, they will need the correct Tool item in their inventory, such as the PokeBall Maintenance kit.\n\nWhen a player begins a **Crafting Project**, the GM creates a **Project Clock** with a number of Spans equal to the Item's Craft Time value.\n\n### Craft Activity - Camp Activity\n\nChoose an item you desire to craft and roll the listed crafting Skill using the following modifiers:\n\n- _Example situational modifiers_:\n  - Using a crafting station or tools you do not own confers a **-10 bonus to the DC**.\n\t- Working in a quiet area confers a **+10 bonus to the DC**.\n  - Utilzing a high-end workspace that makes it substantially easier/faster for you to craft confers a **+30 bonus to the DC**.\n- Crafting an item above one's grade Grade confers a **-10 penalty to the DC per higher Grade**.\n- Crafting an item below one's grade Grade confers a **+10 bonus to the DC**.\n- The crafting Player may spend _Resources_ to improve the result of the roll.\n\nOn a success, you fill in 1 Span of the item’s Project Clock, plus 1 additional Span for every 3 DoS. On a failure, you empty 1 Span of the Project Clock, and with 3+ DoF, the Clock increases in size by 1 Span, up to the a maximum of double the Item's Craft Time value.\n\nWhen the Project Clock is filled, you spend the listed materials, crafting 1 of that item (or one Stack's worth, for \\[Stack X] items).\n\nFor \\[Stack X] items, you craft 1 additional item for each DoS on the crafting roll that completed the Crafting Project. For non-consumable items, you craft one of that item, plus another per additional Grade's worth (E is 1, S+ is 7) of DoS on the roll (if you were crafting a Focus Band, a Grade C Accessory, and you get 5 DoS on the final roll, you end up crafting 2 Focus Bands, since you get an additional one at 4 DoS, 7 DoS, etc.).",

        "content": "<p>While each region in the mainline Pokémon games has their own unique quirks and mechanics, Generation 6 introduced Mega Evolution, which proved to be the first of the trend of GameFreak introducing a new overarching mechanic each generation from then onwards. Because of the tendency to introduce them one generation and deemphasize or remove them in the next, it’s more prudent to call these mechanics, collectively, “Regional Phenomena”, or just <strong>Phenomena</strong> for short. <em>Things related to these Phenomena will possess the <strong>[Phenomenon]</strong> Trait</em>.</p>\n<p>For the purposes of allowing flexibility and options for all campaigns and groups, we are choosing to include specific rules for the Phenomena observed in the mainline series, with the door open to explore those introduced in side games or fan-made games later on.</p>\n<p>However, because they are “regional”, it is advised that GMs use their discretion in making these mechanics available to their campaign. The introduction of many of these items can heavily sway the power and narrative balance of a campaign, especially since all of them are narratively powerful in their source materials and, for the most part. The flavor provided for these mechanics are a guideline, but not a hard and fast ruleset.</p>\n<p>For the purposes of Pokémon Tabletop Evolved, the Phenomena we support as core are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mega Evolution</strong> (first introduced in Pokémon X and Pokémon Y)</li>\n<li><strong>Z-Moves</strong> (first introduced in Pokémon Sun and Pokémon Moon)</li>\n<li><strong>Dynamax</strong> (first introduced in Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield)</li>\n<li><strong>Terastal Phenomenon</strong> (first introduced in Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet)</li>\n<li><strong>Shadow Pokemon</strong> (first introduced in Pokémon Colosseum and refined in Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness)</li>\n<li><strong>Delta Species</strong> (first introduced in Pokémon Trading Card Game’s “EX Delta Species” set and expounded upon in fan-games preceding Gen 7, most notably Pokémon Insurgence)</li>\n<li><strong>Nuclear Type</strong> (introduced and popularized by the fan-game Pokémon Uranium)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Mega Evolution</h1>\n<p><strong>Mega Evolution</strong> is a type of transformation that Pokémon can undergo, operating as a temporary evolution rather than a more standard Forme Change. Broadly speaking, fully evolved Pokémon (and those without any evolutions) are capable of Mega Evolving. While certain extraordinary situations can trigger Mega Evolution for a time, the most reliable method is through the use of a set of Accessories, worn by a Pokémon and a trusted partner. The Pokémon must hold a <strong>Mega Stone</strong> with which it shares a \\<Species> Keyword, and the partner must possess a <strong>Key Stone</strong>, which is a Held Item that can be slotted into another piece of gear, usually an Accessory.</p>\n<p>Following the example of the official and many fan-made Mega Evolutions, this Phenomena acts much the same, but with tweaks to suit the modified approach to Pokémon builds. Similar to the way the more radical Forme Changes are handled, Mega Pokémon are classified as a separate \\<Species>, which provide:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A different set of characteristics and Traits</li>\n<li>A different default Skill spread</li>\n<li>An Extra Ability</li>\n<li>100 points spread out among the Pokémon’s Base Stats except for HP. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Ability gained from Mega Evolution is always added as an Extra Ability and doesn’t replace any Abilities already possessed by the Pokémon. The official Mega Evolutions have had their Abilities changed if 1) the Ability was removed (ie Levitate) or 2) they already possessed the ability before Mega Evolving.</p>\n<p>However, in the scenario that a Pokémon already possesses the Extra Ability from another source (ie, due to Ability Tutoring or someone else's homebrew), the Extra Ability provided by Mega Evolution is instead changed to one of the Starting, Basic, Advanced, Master Abilities it does not have active (user’s choice).</p>\n<p>Mega Evolution may be initialized on either the Pokémon’s or its partner’s activation, via the <em>“Mega Evolve!”</em> Action. If either entity Faints before the Action resolves, the Pokémon does not Mega Evolve. Once successfully resolved, Mega Evolution lasts for the remainder of a combat, even if the user Faints. The Pokémon partner can alternatively disengage the Mega Evolution using the “Power Down!” action. A Key Stone can only Mega Evolve one Pokémon during a combat.</p>\n<p>Out of combat, a Pokémon may be Mega Evolved for up to a single Daytime Span, and may be de-Evolved early through the use of <em>“Power Down!”</em>. If the Mega Evolved Pokémon enters combat after Mega Evolving ahead of time, they are de-Evolved at the end of the combat. When a Pokémon Mega Evolves out of combat, they gain one Stack of Weary upon de-Evolving.</p>\n<p>The Key Stone’s PP Pool can be used for the cost of “Mega Evolve!”, and any subsequent uses must be consumed by the player. The Key Stone has its PP Pool refilled during the Rest Action.</p>\n<p>While Mega Evolved, the Pokémon’s Mega Stone is absorbed into their body, meaning the item no longer occupies an Equipment Slot and cannot be taken from the user through the use of other creatures’ Actions and Abilities.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em><strong>Developer Note</strong>, 8/7/2024</em>\n   Currently, the mechanics of how exactly to fuel the Mega Evolution, and whether it relates to a PP Pool or not, is currently in flux, due to these rules being penned before playtesting began, and the PP economy began to be observed in full.\n  {.is-warning}</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>Z-Moves</h1>\n<p>A Zenith Attack (shortened to <strong>Z-Move</strong>) is a special type of Attack, in which a Pokémon and their partner’s wishes combine to unleash an Attack comprising the full power of both. The Trainer focuses their will into an Accessory Item known as a <strong>Zenith Core</strong>, which magnifies and transmits ambient Z-Power into a <strong>Z-Crystal</strong> or <strong>Z-Power-Crystal</strong> that the Pokémon has equipped as an accessory, allowing the Pokemon to transform one of its Moves into a powerful Z-Move.</p>\n<p>During their Activation, the Pokémon’s partner can use the “Z-Pose!” Action to trigger the activation of a Z-Move that meets the criteria of the held Z-Crystal/Z-Power-Crystal. If either entity Faints before the Action resolves, the Action’s PP Cost is spent, but the effect fails to resolve. A Zenith Core can only power one Z-Move during a Combat. Zenith Cores recharge after a Combat resolves, and can be used during the next Combat.</p>\n<p>Standard Z-Crystals allow for the activation of the Z-Move associated with the \\<Type> of the Z-Crystal, provided the user has an Attack of that Type on their Active List. Physical- and Special-Category Attacks allow for one of the Type-Specific Z-Moves, and Status-Category Moves allow for the use of Zenith Power. Z-Power-Crystals, on the other hand, allow for certain Pokemon Species (and the members of their evolutionary lines) to use specific Z-Moves so long as they have a specific Attack on their Active List.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em><strong>Developer Note</strong>, 8/7/2024</em>\n   Like Megas, the PP consumptions for Z Moves were not designed for our current findings regarding the PP economy and general balance.\n  {.is-warning}</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>Dynamax</h1>\n<p><strong>Dynamax</strong> is a type of special physical transformation Pokémon can undergo, warping the space around them to change their size and affect the world around them, using the incredible power stored within a <strong>Wishing Star</strong>. Two prerequisites must be met before Dynamax can be applied to a Pokémon, however. First, the Pokémon’s partner must be Holding a Wishing Star or be wearing an Accessory Slot item containing a Wishing Star. Second, the Wishing Star must have accumulated enough energy to engage in the process. However, certain extraordinary situations can trigger Dynamaxes for a time, sometimes nearly indefinitely, sometimes involuntarily.</p>\n<p>During their Activation, the Pokémon’s partner can use the “Max Lob!” Action to Dynamax the Pokémon, or the Pokémon may use “Become Giant!” to Dynamax itself. If either entity Faints before the Action resolves, the Pokémon does not Dynamax, and the Wishing Star does not lose its charge, but the PP used for “Max Lob!” or “Become Giant!” is still consumed. Once successfully resolved, a Pokémon remains Dynamaxed for 5 Activations, and loses it prematurely if they Faint. The Pokémon’s partner can alternatively disengage Dynamax using the “Power Down!” action. A Wishing Star can only Dynamax one Pokémon during a combat.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em><strong>Developer Note</strong>, 8/7/2024</em>\n   Like Megas and Z-Moves, the PP consumptions for Dynamaxing were not designed for our current findings regarding the PP economy and general balance.\"Cool-down\" and \"recharge\" mechanics, currently unlisted, are  slated to be accomplished via Downtime.\n  {.is-warning}</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When a Pokémon Dynamaxes, it immediately grows to a truly large size: Medium and smaller Pokémon become Titanic, and Large and larger Pokémon become Max. Creatures that would be within the Dynamaxed Pokémon’s space are then pushed to the nearest unoccupied space that is not adjacent to the Dynamaxed Pokémon. If the Dynamaxed Pokémon would not be able to fit in the space around it at the end of this transformation, the user either shapes the area around it so it can occupy the space (often destroying objects and terrain), or is forcefully moved to a space it can safely occupy. This is done at the discretion of the GM.</p>\n<p>While Dynamaxed, a Pokémon’s HP stat is doubled, and has its HP set to the same percent as it was at before Dynamaxing (rounded up) and has all of its Movement Types increase by 10% per Size Category it grew (so a Large Pokémon gains 50% to all of its Movement Types, while a Huge Pokémon gains 30%). Dynamaxed Pokémon have their Active List temporarily replaced with <strong>Max Attacks</strong> while Dynamaxed, which are provided based on the what is on their Active List prior to Dynamaxing: Max Struggle, Typed [Max] Attacks for all of the Types on the Pokémon’s Active List, Max Guard if the Pokémon had a Status-Category Attack, and a <strong>G-Max</strong> or <strong>E-Max</strong> Attack if the Pokémon meets the Active List Type and \\<Species> requirement.</p>\n<h1>Terastal Phenomenon</h1>\n<p>Terastallization is a type of enhancement and transformation that affects a Pokémon, blinging it out in a massive jewel and giving it extraordinary elemental power. Two prerequisites must be met before a Pokémon can <strong>Terastallize</strong>: a creature possesses a Held Item called a <strong>Tera Orb</strong>, and the Tera Orb must have accumulated enough energy to initiate and sustain the phenomenon.</p>\n<p>During their Activation, the creature can use the “Crystal Pitch!” Action to Terastallize the Pokémon. If either entity Faints before the Action resolves, the Pokémon does not Terastallize, and the Tera Orb does not lose its charge, but the PP used for “Crystal Pitch!” is still consumed. Once successfully resolved, the Pokémon is Terastallized until combat ends and loses it prematurely if they Faint. The Pokémon’s partner can alternatively disengage the Terastal Phenomenon using the “Power Down!” action.</p>\n<p>When a Pokémon Terastallizes, its Typing is completely overridden to its <strong>Tera Type</strong>. A Pokémon’s Tera Type is defined through a \\<Tera Type> Trait denoting which Tera Type it has. The Tera Type for a Pokémon is usually its default Type (or one of its default Types) but through special means a Pokémon can have a different Tera Type or be given a new one. When generated or caught, a Pokémon has an 80% chance for its Tera Type to be one of its default Type(s), and 20% to be any other base Type, including the <strong>Stellar-Type</strong>. GMs including Types beyond the original 18 and Stellar (such as Nuclear and Shadow) can choose to allow Pokémon to have Tera Types beyond the standard 18+1.</p>\n<p>When a Pokémon Terastallizes into the <strong>Stellar-Type</strong>, it still receives STAB for its original Types. The Pokémon then gains an extra STAB bonus for every Type. Once the Pokémon uses a Move of a given Type, it loses that extra STAB for that Type for the remainder of their Terastilization. The Stellar-Type confers no resistances, but has no weaknesses and no Moves may be Tera Type. Logistically, a Stellar-Type Pokémon has no Type-based weaknesses, though certain Moves and Abilities may allow separate increases in effectiveness.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em><strong>Developer Note</strong>, 8/7/2024</em>\n   \"Trainers with Type Sync can change a Pokémon’s Tera Type to match the Type(s) they have access to through Type Sync.\" Meaning, if you change a partner creature's Type, you should be able to change their Tera Type.\n  {.is-warning}</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While Terastilized, a Pokémon cannot have its Typing changed from its Tera Type. A Terastallized Pokémon still receives STAB for its original Types, and receives an extra STAB for its Tera Type. If the Tera Type is the same as one of the original Types, this STAB doubles up. As well, if the Power of an Attack made by Terastilized Pokémon would be under 60 Power after all other modifiers, that Attack’s Power is increased to 60. This floor to Attack Power does not apply to [X-Strike] Attacks.</p>\n<h1>Shadow Pokémon</h1>\n<p><strong>Shadow Pokémon</strong> are an unnatural phenomenon; the result of a Pokémon closing off its heart due to natural or artificial means. They are incredibly distrustful of people, and have been known to Attack anything unprovoked, including their own trainers. Though strong, they are stuck in a state where growth is impossible.

Shadow Pokémon are creatures that possess the special <strong>[Closed Heart]</strong> Trait, which confers a number of effects and mechanics unique to them, which also include unusual behaviors and other qualities that GMs can utilize at their discretion.</p>\n<p>Shadow Pokémon are special Pokémon that are strong in their own right, but this strength comes at the cost of their ability to grow like other Pokémon. There are a few key rules that accompany the [Closed Heart] trait:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pokémon with the Trait have their SPD Stat increased by 50%.</li>\n<li>Possess the Extra Abilities <strong>Hyper Aggressive</strong> and <strong>Coldhearted</strong>.<ul>\n<li><strong>Coldhearted</strong>, specifically, causes them to take 75% less damage from Shadow Type Attacks.</li></ul></li>\n<li>They must always have at least 2 Shadow-Type Attacks on their Active List at all times, but gain an extra slot in their Active List.</li>\n<li>[Closed Heart] creatures grow more slowly, being placed onto a slower experience track.</li>\n<li>Rather than requiring tutoring, these creatures gradually earn Shadow-Type Attacks naturally as part of leveling (essentially a separate Perk Web with its own AP).</li>\n<li>Possess a unique Skill similar to Resources: “<strong>Anguish</strong>”, which governs the Shadow Pokemon’s resistance to Purification.</li>\n<li>Are susceptible to entering Hyper Mode, a unique status condition.</li>\n<li>They cannot utilize Evolution, or undergo miscellaneous transformations (Transform, Phenomena, etc.).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Hyper Mode</h2>\n<p>Hyper Mode is a Status Condition only able to be gained by [Closed Heart]. Hyper Mode occurs when the normally-composed and obedient [Closed Heart] loses that composure and its burgeoning emotions flare up and bubble over, causing its aggression to explode.</p>\n<p>A Pokémon has a chance to gain Hyper Mode after resolving a Shadow-Type Attack. The creature makes a Trivial Lock Test, with the DC reduced by their <em>Natural Tension x5</em> (Tension rules are not currently automated, but are laid out in <a href=\"/rules/social-encounters\">the Social Encounters rules</a>). If the creature rolls above the DC, they gain Hyper Mode.</p>\n<p>While afflicted with Hyper Mode, the afflicted creature gains +20% to all of its Movement Scores, while dealing and taking 15% more damage. As well, the user’s Shadow-Type attacks gain [Crit 1] or [Crit X+1]. At the start of the afflicted creature’s Activations, it has:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a 40% chance to act normally on that Activation,</li>\n<li>a 25% chance to be Choice-Locked 1 to Shadow-Type Attacks,</li>\n<li>a 15% chance of using Fumble and ending its Activation,</li>\n<li>a 15% chance of using Backlash, and</li>\n<li>a 5% chance to be cured of Hyper Mode.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to the 5% chance to be cured of Hyper Mode at the start of their Activations, creatures may be cured by another creature’s “Call!” Action, and may be cured freely as part of a Camp Action.</p>\n<h2>Shadow Type Attacks</h2>\n<p>The [Shadow] \\<Type> is an odd Type. It doesn't acutally fit on the normal Type chart. It only exists on Attacks and some other Actions — it cannot be possessed by a creature as one of that creature’s Typings. It actually functions by interacting with Traits: Shadow-Type attacks are one step super effective against [Pokemon] and [Human] creatures.</p>\n<p>Shadow-Type Attacks are quite brutal in their nature, and the costs of their raw power is surprisingly minimal. Naming-wise, Shadow-Type Attacks have very decisive-sounding names, brutal and “safe” edgy.</p>\n<p>Generally, Shadow-Type Attacks possess three intrinsic properties that differentiate them from other Attacks: 1) Shadow-Type Attacks are copies (or Type-Shifts) of existing Attacks, 2) possess a doubled base Power compared to their original, and 3) possess a reduced (usually halved) PP Cost.</p>\n<h2>Purification</h2>\n<p>Similar to Luck, [Closed Heart] creatures have the unique Skill: <strong>Anguish</strong>. When made into a Shadow Pokémon, a Pokémon’s Anguish is 100. Through interacting with a caring partner that appeals to their true nature, the Pokémon’s Anguish is reduced. Upon hitting zero and taking part in a “Purification Ceremony” Downtime Action, the creature loses <strong>[Closed Heart]</strong> and instead gains <strong>[Triumphant]</strong>. Upon losing [Closed Heart], the creature loses all of the Shadow-Type Attacks it previously possessed alongside the other mechanics and benefits associated with the Trait.</p>\n<p>There are a number of methods to reduce Anguish:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When the creature is cured of Hyper Mode, roll 2d2, and reduce the creature’s Anguish by the result.</li>\n<li>Certain social interactions (such as urging the creature to play with their comrades, participate in a social gathering, etc.) also allow for Anguish to decrease. Make a Hard Skill Test using the Player or interacting NPC’s pertinent Skill. The creature’s Anguish is reduced by <code>4+2xDoS-NRapport</code> on success, or <code>4-NRapport</code> on failure.</li>\n<li>Success in overcoming tough opponents always strengthens the bonds between comrades. After participating in Combat, the creature makes a Challenging Anguish Test. Anguish decreases by <code>2xDoS+NatTension-6</code> on success, and <code>NatTension-6</code> on failure.</li>\n<li>While at Camp, the Player can try to care for the creature, working to open the door to its heart. The Player or valid NPC makes a Challenging Husbandry Test as part of a Downtime Action.

Or maybe they’re particularly unique Shadow Pokémon, having undergone a revolutionary process to give them power or make them extremely difficult to Purify.</p>\n<p>As further options, encountered [Closed Heart] creatures may also possess the <strong>[Apex]</strong> or <strong>[XD]</strong> Traits. [Apex] is designed to be possessed by certain particularly powerful Shadow Pokémon, such as the Cipher Admins’ signature Shadow Pokémon in Colosseum and Gale of Darkness. [XD] meanwhile, would be possessed by exemplary, nigh-on perfect fighting machines like the Lugia in Gale of Darkness: XD-001.</p>\n<p>The [Apex] Trait confers the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For the purposes of calculating Stats and determining obedience, the [Apex]’s Level is considered to be +10 higher.</li>\n<li>An initial Anguish of 150.</li>\n<li>Anytime Anguish would decrease, the amount it is reduced by is decreased by 2.</li>\n<li>The creature’s Movement Scores are increased by 20%.</li>\n<li>An increase to the Active List requirement from 2 to 4 Shadow-Type Attacks, and the creature gains 2 extra Active List Slots instead of 1.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The [XD] Trait confers the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For the purposes of calculating Stats and determining obedience, the [XD]’s Level is considered to be +30 higher.</li>\n<li>An initial Anguish of 200.</li>\n<li>Anytime Anguish would decrease, the amount it is reduced by is decreased by 6.</li>\n<li>The creature’s Movement Scores are increased by 40%.</li>\n<li>An increase to the Active List requirement from 2 to 6 Shadow-Type Attacks, and the creature gains 3 extra Active List Slots instead of 1.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Like with [Closed Heart], [Apex] and [XD] are lost upon Purification.</p>\n<p>For both [Apex] and [XD], it is recommended that, in order to differentiate them from baseline [Closed Heart], GMs should consider including additional boons, either while still [Closed Heart], upon Purification, or as part of [Triumphant]:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide access to additional homebrewed Shadow-Type Attacks for their specific use; Type-Shifting existing Attacks (for [Legendary] Pokemon, it is recommended to Type-Shift their signature Attacks), improve existing or Type-Shifted-to-Shadow Attacks, or create new, substantial Shadow-Type Attacks entirely (both ideal for particularly powerful [XD] specimens).</li>\n<li>Confer a second Extra Ability of the GM’s choice (better for [XD], but can still be provided to [Apex]).</li>\n<li>Provide innate, passive increases to one or more Stat stages.</li>\n<li>Increase the amount of free, special Tutored Attacks upon Purification.</li>\n<li>Provide innate Base Stat increases or have the effective Level for Stat Calculations and obedience be higher while [Closed Heart], or persist entirely or in some fashion upon gaining [Triumphant].</li>\n<li>Allowing the [Triumphant] [Pokémon] retain 1 or more Shadow-Type Attacks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Optional Rules</h2>\n<p>***Still in progress\n[Ultra] and [Paradox] [Pokémon] cannot be given the [Closed Heart] Trait.</p>\n<h1>Delta Species</h1>\n<p>First conceived as “ẟ Delta Species” for the Pokémon TCG, <strong>Delta Species</strong> Pokémon (<strong>Deltas</strong> or <strong>Delta Pokémon</strong> for short) predate the idea of “regional variants.” Where regional variants are more… reasonable in terms of their differences in morphology and changes in Typing and Abilities, Delta Species are very different in terms of Typing, Abilities, and general appearance but still closely resemble the species they’re modified from, maintaining a similar silhouette, sharing similar size and weight, and keeping nearly-identical Base Stats. In this way, they’re essentially the midpoint between regional variants and the Paradox Pokémon.</p>\n<p>Like regional variants, Deltas had a similar surge in the fan community after their introduction, leading to a ton of creative works in their wake, most notably coalescing into the roster of Delta Pokémon introduced in the <em>Pokémon Insurgence</em> fan-game.</p>\n<p>Delta Pokémon, for all intents and purposes, are just more exotic regional variants that are generally unnatural-looking, and are frequently more battle-capable than their original version. The lore for them in both the TCG and in <em>Insurgence</em> dictates them being anomalous and rare. It is recommended that should GMs utilize Delta Species Pokémon, they do so understanding their fairly unusual position relative to other Pokémon, and should utilize them considering possible ramifications to their campaign setting and story and possible in-combat balance.</p>\n<h2>Nuclear Type</h2>\n<p>The <strong>Nuclear Type</strong> is a \\<Type> introduced in the fan-game Pokémon Uranium. There are a number of Pokémon exclusive to Uranium that possess the [Nuclear] \\<Type> innately, and have pertinent Attacks and Abilities.</p>\n<p>Unlike standard types, Nuclear possesses similar corruptive properties to Shadow Pokémon. Regular Pokémon that are exposed to an undue amount of radiation will become corrupted and feral, turning a different color and gain the Trait <strong>[Contaminated]</strong>. Unlike [Closed Heart], however, those who have become corrupted can evolve and undergo Phenomena.</p>\n<p>[Contaminated] simply gain the [Nuclear] Type. Through special mechanical processes, generally through working with special scientists or being a skilled scientist yourself, [Contaminated] can be cured and the creature returned to their normal state.</p>\n<p>Unlike the Shadow-Type, the Nuclear-Type functions more like a conventional Typing. Offensively, Nuclear Attacks are super effective on all conventional Types except Steel and Nuclear itself, and defensively only resists itself. As is evident, Nuclear is simultaneously very dangerous but also extremely volatile, making [Nuclear] Pokémon more prone to being glass cannons.</p>\n<p>GMs should exercise caution with making Nuclear-Type available in their campaign. While less mechanically-involved than Shadow Pokémon, Nuclear is also potentially campaign- and balance-warping.</p>",
        "markdown": "While each region in the mainline Pokémon games has their own unique quirks and mechanics, Generation 6 introduced Mega Evolution, which proved to be the first of the trend of GameFreak introducing a new overarching mechanic each generation from then onwards. Because of the tendency to introduce them one generation and deemphasize or remove them in the next, it’s more prudent to call these mechanics, collectively, “Regional Phenomena”, or just **Phenomena** for short. _Things related to these Phenomena will possess the **[Phenomenon]** Trait_.\n\nFor the purposes of allowing flexibility and options for all campaigns and groups, we are choosing to include specific rules for the Phenomena observed in the mainline series, with the door open to explore those introduced in side games or fan-made games later on.\n\nHowever, because they are “regional”, it is advised that GMs use their discretion in making these mechanics available to their campaign. The introduction of many of these items can heavily sway the power and narrative balance of a campaign, especially since all of them are narratively powerful in their source materials and, for the most part. The flavor provided for these mechanics are a guideline, but not a hard and fast ruleset.\n\nFor the purposes of Pokémon Tabletop Evolved, the Phenomena we support as core are as follows:\n- **Mega Evolution** (first introduced in Pokémon X and Pokémon Y)\n- **Z-Moves** (first introduced in Pokémon Sun and Pokémon Moon)\n- **Dynamax** (first introduced in Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield)\n- **Terastal Phenomenon** (first introduced in Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet)\n- **Shadow Pokemon** (first introduced in Pokémon Colosseum and refined in Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness)\n- **Delta Species** (first introduced in Pokémon Trading Card Game’s “EX Delta Species” set and expounded upon in fan-games preceding Gen 7, most notably Pokémon Insurgence)\n- **Nuclear Type** (introduced and popularized by the fan-game Pokémon Uranium)\n\n# Mega Evolution\n**Mega Evolution** is a type of transformation that Pokémon can undergo, operating as a temporary evolution rather than a more standard Forme Change. Broadly speaking, fully evolved Pokémon (and those without any evolutions) are capable of Mega Evolving. While certain extraordinary situations can trigger Mega Evolution for a time, the most reliable method is through the use of a set of Accessories, worn by a Pokémon and a trusted partner. The Pokémon must hold a **Mega Stone** with which it shares a \\<Species> Keyword, and the partner must possess a **Key Stone**, which is a Held Item that can be slotted into another piece of gear, usually an Accessory.\n\nFollowing the example of the official and many fan-made Mega Evolutions, this Phenomena acts much the same, but with tweaks to suit the modified approach to Pokémon builds. Similar to the way the more radical Forme Changes are handled, Mega Pokémon are classified as a separate \\<Species>, which provide:\n- A different set of characteristics and Traits\n- A different default Skill spread\n- An Extra Ability\n- 100 points spread out among the Pokémon’s Base Stats except for HP. \n\nThe Ability gained from Mega Evolution is always added as an Extra Ability and doesn’t replace any Abilities already possessed by the Pokémon. The official Mega Evolutions have had their Abilities changed if 1) the Ability was removed (ie Levitate) or 2) they already possessed the ability before Mega Evolving.\n  \nHowever, in the scenario that a Pokémon already possesses the Extra Ability from another source (ie, due to Ability Tutoring or someone else's homebrew), the Extra Ability provided by Mega Evolution is instead changed to one of the Starting, Basic, Advanced, Master Abilities it does not have active (user’s choice).\n\nMega Evolution may be initialized on either the Pokémon’s or its partner’s activation, via the _“Mega Evolve!”_ Action. If either entity Faints before the Action resolves, the Pokémon does not Mega Evolve. Once successfully resolved, Mega Evolution lasts for the remainder of a combat, even if the user Faints. The Pokémon partner can alternatively disengage the Mega Evolution using the “Power Down!” action. A Key Stone can only Mega Evolve one Pokémon during a combat.\n\nOut of combat, a Pokémon may be Mega Evolved for up to a single Daytime Span, and may be de-Evolved early through the use of _“Power Down!”_. If the Mega Evolved Pokémon enters combat after Mega Evolving ahead of time, they are de-Evolved at the end of the combat. When a Pokémon Mega Evolves out of combat, they gain one Stack of Weary upon de-Evolving.\n\nThe Key Stone’s PP Pool can be used for the cost of “Mega Evolve!”, and any subsequent uses must be consumed by the player. The Key Stone has its PP Pool refilled during the Rest Action.\n\nWhile Mega Evolved, the Pokémon’s Mega Stone is absorbed into their body, meaning the item no longer occupies an Equipment Slot and cannot be taken from the user through the use of other creatures’ Actions and Abilities.\n  \n>  _**Developer Note**, 8/7/2024_\n>  Currently, the mechanics of how exactly to fuel the Mega Evolution, and whether it relates to a PP Pool or not, is currently in flux, due to these rules being penned before playtesting began, and the PP economy began to be observed in full.\n{.is-warning}\n\n# Z-Moves\nA Zenith Attack (shortened to **Z-Move**) is a special type of Attack, in which a Pokémon and their partner’s wishes combine to unleash an Attack comprising the full power of both. The Trainer focuses their will into an Accessory Item known as a **Zenith Core**, which magnifies and transmits ambient Z-Power into a **Z-Crystal** or **Z-Power-Crystal** that the Pokémon has equipped as an accessory, allowing the Pokemon to transform one of its Moves into a powerful Z-Move.\n\nDuring their Activation, the Pokémon’s partner can use the “Z-Pose!” Action to trigger the activation of a Z-Move that meets the criteria of the held Z-Crystal/Z-Power-Crystal. If either entity Faints before the Action resolves, the Action’s PP Cost is spent, but the effect fails to resolve. A Zenith Core can only power one Z-Move during a Combat. Zenith Cores recharge after a Combat resolves, and can be used during the next Combat.\n\nStandard Z-Crystals allow for the activation of the Z-Move associated with the \\<Type> of the Z-Crystal, provided the user has an Attack of that Type on their Active List. Physical- and Special-Category Attacks allow for one of the Type-Specific Z-Moves, and Status-Category Moves allow for the use of Zenith Power. Z-Power-Crystals, on the other hand, allow for certain Pokemon Species (and the members of their evolutionary lines) to use specific Z-Moves so long as they have a specific Attack on their Active List.\n  \n>  _**Developer Note**, 8/7/2024_\n>  Like Megas, the PP consumptions for Z Moves were not designed for our current findings regarding the PP economy and general balance.\n{.is-warning}\n\n# Dynamax\n**Dynamax** is a type of special physical transformation Pokémon can undergo, warping the space around them to change their size and affect the world around them, using the incredible power stored within a **Wishing Star**. Two prerequisites must be met before Dynamax can be applied to a Pokémon, however. First, the Pokémon’s partner must be Holding a Wishing Star or be wearing an Accessory Slot item containing a Wishing Star. Second, the Wishing Star must have accumulated enough energy to engage in the process. However, certain extraordinary situations can trigger Dynamaxes for a time, sometimes nearly indefinitely, sometimes involuntarily.\n\nDuring their Activation, the Pokémon’s partner can use the “Max Lob!” Action to Dynamax the Pokémon, or the Pokémon may use “Become Giant!” to Dynamax itself. If either entity Faints before the Action resolves, the Pokémon does not Dynamax, and the Wishing Star does not lose its charge, but the PP used for “Max Lob!” or “Become Giant!” is still consumed. Once successfully resolved, a Pokémon remains Dynamaxed for 5 Activations, and loses it prematurely if they Faint. The Pokémon’s partner can alternatively disengage Dynamax using the “Power Down!” action. A Wishing Star can only Dynamax one Pokémon during a combat.\n  \n>  _**Developer Note**, 8/7/2024_\n>  Like Megas and Z-Moves, the PP consumptions for Dynamaxing were not designed for our current findings regarding the PP economy and general balance.\"Cool-down\" and \"recharge\" mechanics, currently unlisted, are  slated to be accomplished via Downtime.\n{.is-warning}\n\nWhen a Pokémon Dynamaxes, it immediately grows to a truly large size: Medium and smaller Pokémon become Titanic, and Large and larger Pokémon become Max. Creatures that would be within the Dynamaxed Pokémon’s space are then pushed to the nearest unoccupied space that is not adjacent to the Dynamaxed Pokémon. If the Dynamaxed Pokémon would not be able to fit in the space around it at the end of this transformation, the user either shapes the area around it so it can occupy the space (often destroying objects and terrain), or is forcefully moved to a space it can safely occupy. This is done at the discretion of the GM.\n\nWhile Dynamaxed, a Pokémon’s HP stat is doubled, and has its HP set to the same percent as it was at before Dynamaxing (rounded up) and has all of its Movement Types increase by 10% per Size Category it grew (so a Large Pokémon gains 50% to all of its Movement Types, while a Huge Pokémon gains 30%). Dynamaxed Pokémon have their Active List temporarily replaced with **Max Attacks** while Dynamaxed, which are provided based on the what is on their Active List prior to Dynamaxing: Max Struggle, Typed [Max] Attacks for all of the Types on the Pokémon’s Active List, Max Guard if the Pokémon had a Status-Category Attack, and a **G-Max** or **E-Max** Attack if the Pokémon meets the Active List Type and \\<Species> requirement.\n\n# Terastal Phenomenon\nTerastallization is a type of enhancement and transformation that affects a Pokémon, blinging it out in a massive jewel and giving it extraordinary elemental power. Two prerequisites must be met before a Pokémon can **Terastallize**: a creature possesses a Held Item called a **Tera Orb**, and the Tera Orb must have accumulated enough energy to initiate and sustain the phenomenon.\n\nDuring their Activation, the creature can use the “Crystal Pitch!” Action to Terastallize the Pokémon. If either entity Faints before the Action resolves, the Pokémon does not Terastallize, and the Tera Orb does not lose its charge, but the PP used for “Crystal Pitch!” is still consumed. Once successfully resolved, the Pokémon is Terastallized until combat ends and loses it prematurely if they Faint. The Pokémon’s partner can alternatively disengage the Terastal Phenomenon using the “Power Down!” action.\n\nWhen a Pokémon Terastallizes, its Typing is completely overridden to its **Tera Type**. A Pokémon’s Tera Type is defined through a \\<Tera Type> Trait denoting which Tera Type it has. The Tera Type for a Pokémon is usually its default Type (or one of its default Types) but through special means a Pokémon can have a different Tera Type or be given a new one. When generated or caught, a Pokémon has an 80% chance for its Tera Type to be one of its default Type(s), and 20% to be any other base Type, including the **Stellar-Type**. GMs including Types beyond the original 18 and Stellar (such as Nuclear and Shadow) can choose to allow Pokémon to have Tera Types beyond the standard 18+1.\n\nWhen a Pokémon Terastallizes into the **Stellar-Type**, it still receives STAB for its original Types. The Pokémon then gains an extra STAB bonus for every Type. Once the Pokémon uses a Move of a given Type, it loses that extra STAB for that Type for the remainder of their Terastilization. The Stellar-Type confers no resistances, but has no weaknesses and no Moves may be Tera Type. Logistically, a Stellar-Type Pokémon has no Type-based weaknesses, though certain Moves and Abilities may allow separate increases in effectiveness.\n\n> _**Developer Note**, 8/7/2024_\n>  \"Trainers with Type Sync can change a Pokémon’s Tera Type to match the Type(s) they have access to through Type Sync.\" Meaning, if you change a partner creature's Type, you should be able to change their Tera Type.\n{.is-warning}\n\nWhile Terastilized, a Pokémon cannot have its Typing changed from its Tera Type. A Terastallized Pokémon still receives STAB for its original Types, and receives an extra STAB for its Tera Type. If the Tera Type is the same as one of the original Types, this STAB doubles up. As well, if the Power of an Attack made by Terastilized Pokémon would be under 60 Power after all other modifiers, that Attack’s Power is increased to 60. This floor to Attack Power does not apply to [X-Strike] Attacks.\n\n# Shadow Pokémon\n**Shadow Pokémon** are an unnatural phenomenon; the result of a Pokémon closing off its heart due to natural or artificial means. They are incredibly distrustful of people, and have been known to Attack anything unprovoked, including their own trainers. Though strong, they are stuck in a state where growth is impossible. Caution to any trainer that obtains one of these beasts.\n## Unique Traits and General Rules\nShadow Pokémon, as a result of the mechanism or phenomenon that granted them the Shadow Type, have had their “hearts shut”, transforming them into soulless fighting machines. Shadow Pokémon are creatures that possess the special **[Closed Heart]** Trait, which confers a number of effects and mechanics unique to them, which also include unusual behaviors and other qualities that GMs can utilize at their discretion.\n\nShadow Pokémon are special Pokémon that are strong in their own right, but this strength comes at the cost of their ability to grow like other Pokémon. There are a few key rules that accompany the [Closed Heart] trait:\n- Pokémon with the Trait have their SPD Stat increased by 50%.\n- Possess the Extra Abilities **Hyper Aggressive** and **Coldhearted**.\n  - **Coldhearted**, specifically, causes them to take 75% less damage from Shadow Type Attacks.\n- They must always have at least 2 Shadow-Type Attacks on their Active List at all times, but gain an extra slot in their Active List.\n- [Closed Heart] creatures grow more slowly, being placed onto a slower experience track.\n- Rather than requiring tutoring, these creatures gradually earn Shadow-Type Attacks naturally as part of leveling (essentially a separate Perk Web with its own AP).\n- Possess a unique Skill similar to Resources: “**Anguish**”, which governs the Shadow Pokemon’s resistance to Purification.\n- Are susceptible to entering Hyper Mode, a unique status condition.\n- They cannot utilize Evolution, or undergo miscellaneous transformations (Transform, Phenomena, etc.).\n\n## Hyper Mode\nHyper Mode is a Status Condition only able to be gained by [Closed Heart]. Hyper Mode occurs when the normally-composed and obedient [Closed Heart] loses that composure and its burgeoning emotions flare up and bubble over, causing its aggression to explode.\n\nA Pokémon has a chance to gain Hyper Mode after resolving a Shadow-Type Attack.

As well, the user’s Shadow-Type attacks gain [Crit 1] or [Crit X+1]. At the start of the afflicted creature’s Activations, it has:\n- a 40% chance to act normally on that Activation,\n- a 25% chance to be Choice-Locked 1 to Shadow-Type Attacks,\n- a 15% chance of using Fumble and ending its Activation,\n- a 15% chance of using Backlash, and\n- a 5% chance to be cured of Hyper Mode.\n\nIn addition to the 5% chance to be cured of Hyper Mode at the start of their Activations, creatures may be cured by another creature’s “Call!” Action, and may be cured freely as part of a Camp Action.\n\n## Shadow Type Attacks\nThe [Shadow] \\<Type> is an odd Type.

[XD] meanwhile, would be possessed by exemplary, nigh-on perfect fighting machines like the Lugia in Gale of Darkness: XD-001.\n\nThe [Apex] Trait confers the following:\n- For the purposes of calculating Stats and determining obedience, the [Apex]’s Level is considered to be +10 higher.\n- An initial Anguish of 150.\n- Anytime Anguish would decrease, the amount it is reduced by is decreased by 2.\n- The creature’s Movement Scores are increased by 20%.\n- An increase to the Active List requirement from 2 to 4 Shadow-Type Attacks, and the creature gains 2 extra Active List Slots instead of 1.\n\nThe [XD] Trait confers the following:\n- For the purposes of calculating Stats and determining obedience, the [XD]’s Level is considered to be +30 higher.\n- An initial Anguish of 200.\n- Anytime Anguish would decrease, the amount it is reduced by is decreased by 6.\n- The creature’s Movement Scores are increased by 40%.\n- An increase to the Active List requirement from 2 to 6 Shadow-Type Attacks, and the creature gains 3 extra Active List Slots instead of 1.\n\nLike with [Closed Heart], [Apex] and [XD] are lost upon Purification.\n\nFor both [Apex] and [XD], it is recommended that, in order to differentiate them from baseline [Closed Heart], GMs should consider including additional boons, either while still [Closed Heart], upon Purification, or as part of [Triumphant]:\n- Provide access to additional homebrewed Shadow-Type Attacks for their specific use; Type-Shifting existing Attacks (for [Legendary] Pokemon, it is recommended to Type-Shift their signature Attacks), improve existing or Type-Shifted-to-Shadow Attacks, or create new, substantial Shadow-Type Attacks entirely (both ideal for particularly powerful [XD] specimens).\n- Confer a second Extra Ability of the GM’s choice (better for [XD], but can still be provided to [Apex]).\n- Provide innate, passive increases to one or more Stat stages.\n- Increase the amount of free, special Tutored Attacks upon Purification.\n- Provide innate Base Stat increases or have the effective Level for Stat Calculations and obedience be higher while [Closed Heart], or persist entirely or in some fashion upon gaining [Triumphant].\n- Allowing the [Triumphant] [Pokémon] retain 1 or more Shadow-Type Attacks.\n\n## Optional Rules\n***Still in progress\n[Ultra] and [Paradox] [Pokémon] cannot be given the [Closed Heart] Trait.\n\n# Delta Species\nFirst conceived as “ẟ Delta Species” for the Pokémon TCG, **Delta Species** Pokémon (**Deltas** or **Delta Pokémon** for short) predate the idea of “regional variants.” Where regional variants are more… reasonable in terms of their differences in morphology and changes in Typing and Abilities, Delta Species are very different in terms of Typing, Abilities, and general appearance but still closely resemble the species they’re modified from, maintaining a similar silhouette, sharing similar size and weight, and keeping nearly-identical Base Stats. In this way, they’re essentially the midpoint between regional variants and the Paradox Pokémon.\n\nLike regional variants, Deltas had a similar surge in the fan community after their introduction, leading to a ton of creative works in their wake, most notably coalescing into the roster of Delta Pokémon introduced in the *Pokémon Insurgence* fan-game.\n\nDelta Pokémon, for all intents and purposes, are just more exotic regional variants that are generally unnatural-looking, and are frequently more battle-capable than their original version. The lore for them in both the TCG and in *Insurgence* dictates them being anomalous and rare. It is recommended that should GMs utilize Delta Species Pokémon, they do so understanding their fairly unusual position relative to other Pokémon, and should utilize them considering possible ramifications to their campaign setting and story and possible in-combat balance.\n\n## Nuclear Type\nThe **Nuclear Type** is a \\<Type> introduced in the fan-game Pokémon Uranium. There are a number of Pokémon exclusive to Uranium that possess the [Nuclear] \\<Type> innately, and have pertinent Attacks and Abilities.\n\nUnlike standard types, Nuclear possesses similar corruptive properties to Shadow Pokémon. Regular Pokémon that are exposed to an undue amount of radiation will become corrupted and feral, turning a different color and gain the Trait **[Contaminated]**. Unlike [Closed Heart], however, those who have become corrupted can evolve and undergo Phenomena.\n\n[Contaminated] simply gain the [Nuclear] Type. Through special mechanical processes, generally through working with special scientists or being a skilled scientist yourself, [Contaminated] can be cured and the creature returned to their normal state.\n\nUnlike the Shadow-Type, the Nuclear-Type functions more like a conventional Typing. Offensively, Nuclear Attacks are super effective on all conventional Types except Steel and Nuclear itself, and defensively only resists itself. As is evident, Nuclear is simultaneously very dangerous but also extremely volatile, making [Nuclear] Pokémon more prone to being glass cannons.\n\nGMs should exercise caution with making Nuclear-Type available in their campaign. While less mechanically-involved than Shadow Pokémon, Nuclear is also potentially campaign- and balance-warping.",

        "content": "<p>While each region in the mainline Pokémon games has their own unique quirks and mechanics, Generation 6 introduced Mega Evolution, which proved to be the first of the trend of GameFreak introducing a new overarching mechanic each generation from then onwards. Because of the tendency to introduce them one generation and deemphasize or remove them in the next, it’s more prudent to call these mechanics, collectively, “Regional Phenomena”, or just <strong>Phenomena</strong> for short. <em>Things related to these Phenomena will possess the [Phenomenon] Trait</em>.</p>\n<p>For the purposes of allowing flexibility and options for all campaigns and groups, we are choosing to include specific rules for the Phenomena observed in the mainline series, with the door open to explore those introduced in side games or fan-made games later on.</p>\n<p>However, because they are “regional”, <em>it is advised that GMs use their discretion in making these mechanics available to their campaign</em>. The introduction of many of these items can heavily sway the power and narrative balance of a campaign, especially since all of them are narratively powerful in their source materials and, for the most part. The flavor provided for these mechanics are a guideline, but not a hard and fast ruleset.</p>\n<p>For the purposes of Pokémon Tabletop Evolved, the Phenomena we support as core are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Mega Evolution</em> (first introduced in <em>Pokémon X</em> and <em>Pokémon Y</em>)</li>\n<li><em>Z-Moves</em> (first introduced in <em>Pokémon Sun</em> and <em>Pokémon Moon</em>)</li>\n<li><em>Dynamax</em> (first introduced in <em>Pokémon Sword</em> and <em>Pokémon Shield</em>)</li>\n<li><em>Terastal Phenomenon</em> (first introduced in <em>Pokémon Scarlet</em> and <em>Pokémon Violet</em>)</li>\n<li><em>Shadow Pokemon</em> (first introduced in <em>Pokémon Colosseum</em> and refined in <em>Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness</em>)</li>\n<li><em>Delta Species</em> (first introduced in the <em>Pokémon Trading Card Game</em>’s “EX Delta Species” set and expounded upon in fan-games preceding Gen 7, most notably <em>Pokémon Insurgence</em>)</li>\n<li><em>Nuclear Type</em> (introduced and popularized by the fan-game <em>Pokémon Uranium</em>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Mega Evolution</h1>\n<p><strong>Mega Evolution</strong> is a type of transformation that Pokémon can undergo, operating as a temporary evolution rather than a more standard Forme Change. Broadly speaking, fully evolved Pokémon (and those without any evolutions) are capable of Mega Evolving. While certain extraordinary situations can trigger Mega Evolution for a time, the most reliable method is through the use of a set of Accessories, worn by a Pokémon and a trusted partner. The Pokémon must hold a <strong>Mega Stone</strong> with which it shares a <Species> Keyword, and the partner must possess a <strong>Key Stone</strong>, which is a Held Item that can be slotted into another piece of gear.</p>\n<p>Following the example of the official and many fan-made Mega Evolutions, this Phenomena acts much the same, but with tweaks to suit the modified approach to Pokémon builds. Similar to the way the more radical Forme Changes are handled, Mega Pokémon are classified as a separate <Species>, which provide:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A different set of characteristics and Traits (usually expansions on what the creature originally had)</li>\n<li>An Extra Ability</li>\n<li>A different default Skill spread</li>\n<li>100 points spread out among the Pokémon’s Base Stats except for HP.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Ability gained from Mega Evolution is always added as an <em>Extra Ability</em> and doesn’t replace any Abilities already possessed by the Pokémon, However, in the scenario that a Pokémon already possesses the Extra Ability from another source, the Extra Ability provided by Mega Evolution is instead changed to one of the Starting, Basic, Advanced, Master Abilities it does not have active (user’s choice).</p>\n<p>Mega Evolution may be initialized on either the Pokémon’s or its partner’s activation, via the “<em>Mega Evolve!</em>” Action. If either entity Faints before the Action resolves, the Pokémon does not Mega Evolve. Once successfully resolved, Mega Evolution lasts for the remainder of a combat, even if the user Faints. The Pokémon partner can alternatively disengage the Mega Evolution using the “<em>Power Down!</em>” action. A Key Stone can only Mega Evolve one Pokémon during a combat.</p>\n<p>Out of combat, a Pokémon may be Mega Evolved for up to a single Daytime Span, and may be de-Evolved early through the use of “Power Down!”. If the Mega Evolved Pokémon enters combat after Mega Evolving ahead of time, they are de-Evolved at the end of the combat. When a Pokémon Mega Evolves out of combat, they gain one Stack of Weary upon de-Evolving.</p>\n<p>The Key Stone’s <strong>PP Pool</strong> can be used for the cost of “Mega Evolve!”, and any subsequent uses must be consumed by the player. The Key Stone has its PP Pool refilled during the Rest Action.</p>\n<p>While Mega Evolved, the Pokémon’s Mega Stone is absorbed into their body, meaning the item no longer occupies an Equipment Slot and cannot be taken from the user through the use of other creatures’ Actions and Abilities.</p>\n<h1>Z-Moves</h1>\n<p>A <strong>Zenith Move</strong> (shortened to <strong>Z-Move</strong>) is a special type of Attack, in which a Pokémon and their partner’s wishes combine to unleash an Attack comprising the full power of both creatures. The partner focuses their will into an Accessory Item known as a Zenith Core, which magnifies and transmits ambient <strong>Z-Power</strong> into s <strong>Z-Crystal</strong> or <strong>Z-Power-Crystal</strong> that the Pokémon has equipped as an accessory, allowing the Pokemon to transform one of its Moves into a powerful Z-Move.</p>\n<p>During their Activation, the Pokémon’s partner can use the “<em>Z-Pose!</em>” Action to trigger the activation of a Z-Move that meets the criteria of the held Z-Crystal/Z-Power-Crystal. If either entity Faints before the Action resolves, the Action’s PP Cost is spent, but the effect fails to resolve. A Zenith Core can only power one Z-Move during a Combat. Zenith Cores recharge after a Combat resolves, and can be used during the next Combat.</p>\n<p>Standard Z-Crystals allow for the activation of the <strong>[Zenith]</strong> Attack associated with the <Type> of the Z-Crystal, provided the user has an Attack of that Type on their Active List. Physical- and Special-Category Attacks allow for one of the Type-Specific Z-Moves, and Status-Category Moves allow for the use of the Attack \"Zenith Power.\" Z-Power-Crystals, on the other hand, allow for certain Pokemon Species (and the members of their evolutionary lines) to use specific Z-Moves so long as they have a specific Attack on their Active List.</p>\n<h1>Dynamax</h1>\n<p><strong>Dynamax</strong> is a type of special physical transformation Pokémon can undergo, warping the space around them to change their size and affect the world around them, using the incredible power stored within a <strong>Wishing Star</strong>. Two prerequisites must be met before Dynamax can be applied to a Pokémon, however. First, the Pokémon’s partner must be Holding a Wishing Star or be wearing an Accessory Slot item containing a Wishing Star. Second, the Wishing Star must have accumulated enough energy to engage in the process. However, certain extraordinary situations can trigger Dynamaxes for a time, sometimes nearly indefinitely, sometimes involuntarily.</p>\n<p>During their Activation, the Pokémon’s partner can use the “<em>Max Lob!</em>” Action to Dynamax the Pokémon, or the Pokémon may use “<em>Become Giant!</em>” to Dynamax itself. If either entity Faints before the Action resolves, the Pokémon does not Dynamax, and the Wishing Star does not lose its charge, but the PP used for “Max Lob!” or “Become Giant!” is still consumed. Once successfully resolved, a Pokémon remains Dynamaxed for 5 Activations, and loses it prematurely if they Faint. The Pokémon’s partner can alternatively disengage Dynamax using the “Power Down!” action. A Wishing Star can only Dynamax one Pokémon during a combat.</p>\n<p>When a Pokémon Dynamaxes, it immediately grows to a truly large size: Medium and smaller Pokémon have their Size Category set to \"Titanic,\" and Large and larger Pokémon have their Size Category set to \"Max.\" Creatures that would be within the Dynamaxed Pokémon’s space are then pushed to the nearest unoccupied space that is not adjacent to the Dynamaxed Pokémon. If the Dynamaxed Pokémon would not be able to fit in the space around it at the end of this transformation, the user either shapes the area around it so it can occupy the space (often destroying objects and terrain), or is forcefully moved to a space it can safely occupy. This is done at the discretion of the GM.</p>\n<p>While Dynamaxed, a Pokémon:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Has its HP stat, after all other modifiers, doubled, and has its current HP set to the same percent it was at before Dynamaxing</em> (rounded up)</li>\n<li><em>Has all of its Movement Score increase by 10% per Size Category increase</em> (so a Large Pokémon gains 50% to all of its Movement Types, while a Huge Pokémon gains 30%).</li>\n<li><em>Has all of the Attacks on the their Active List temporarily replaced with <strong>[Max]</strong> Attacks while Dynamaxed</em>, which are provided based on the what is on their Active List prior to Dynamaxing:<ul>\n<li>\"Max Struggle,\" which replaces \"Struggle\"</li>\n<li>\"Max Guard,\" which replaces all Status-Category Attacks.</li>\n<li><Type> [Max] Attacks, which are added corresponding to the <Type> of the Physical- and Special-Category Attacks Pokémon’s Active List</li>\n<li>\"G-Max\" Attacks, if the Pokémon meets the Active List <Type> and <Species> requirement for those specific [Max] Attacks</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The partner's Wishing Star’s <strong>PP Pool</strong> can be used for the cost of “<em>Become Giant!</em>”, and any subsequent uses must be consumed by the Pokémon using \"<em>Become Giant!</em>.\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Development Note</em>: mechanics regarding the recharge/replenishment of the Wishing Star are still forthcoming.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>Terastal Phenomenon</h1>\n<p><strong>Terastallization</strong> is a type of enhancement and transformation that affects a Pokémon, blinging it out in a massive jewel and giving it extraordinary elemental power. Two prerequisites must be met before a Pokémon can Terastallize: a Pokémon's partner possesses a Held Item called a <strong>Tera Orb</strong>, and the Tera Orb must have accumulated enough energy to initiate and sustain the phenomenon.</p>\n<p>During their Activation, the partner creature can use the “<em>Crystal Pitch!</em>” Action to Terastallize the Pokémon. If either entity Faints before the Action resolves, the Pokémon does not Terastallize , and the Tera Orb does not lose its charge, but the PP used for “Crystal Pitch!” is still consumed. Once successfully resolved, the Pokémon is Terastallized until combat ends and loses it prematurely if they Faint. The Pokémon’s partner can alternatively disengage the Terastal Phenomenon using the “<em>Power Down!</em>” action.</p>\n<p>When a Pokémon Terastallizes, its Typing is completely overridden to its <strong>Tera Type</strong>. A Pokémon’s Tera Type is defined through a <Tera Type> Trait denoting which Tera <Type> it has. The Tera Type for a Pokémon is usually its inherent Type(s), but through special means a Pokémon can have a different Tera Type or be given a new one. When generated or caught, a Pokémon has an 80% chance for its Tera Type to be one of its default Type(s), and 20% to be any other base Type, including the Stellar-Type. GMs including Types beyond the original 18 and Stellar (such as Nuclear and Shadow) can choose to allow Pokémon to have Tera Types beyond the standard 18+1.</p>\n<p>Trainers with Type Sync can change a Pokémon’s Tera Type to match the Type(s) they have access to through Type Sync.</p>\n<p>While Terastilized, a Pokémon:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Cannot have its <Type>ing changed from its Tera Type</em></li>\n<li><em>Continues to receive STAB for its original <Type>s</em></li>\n<li><em>Receives an extra STAB for its <Tera Type></em><ul>\n<li>If the <Tera Type> is the same as one of the original <Type>s, this STAB doubles up.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Development Note</em>: tenatively, we are <strong><em>not</em></strong> including the \"minimum Attack Power is 60\" effect from the mainline games.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The partner's Tera Orb’s <strong>PP Pool</strong> can be used for the cost of “<em>Crystal Pitch!</em>”, and any subsequent uses must be consumed by the Pokémon targetted by \"<em>Crystal Pitch!</em>.\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Development Note</em>: mechanics regarding the recharge/replenishment of the Tera Orb are still forthcoming.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Stellar-Type</h2>\n<p>When a Pokémon Terastallizes into the <strong>Stellar-Type</strong>, it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Still receives STAB for its original <Types></em></li>\n<li><em>Gains a one-time extra STAB bonus for every Type</em>.<ul>\n<li>Once the Pokémon uses a Move of a given Type, it loses that extra STAB for that Type for the remainder of their Terastilization.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The [Stellar] <Type>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Possess no resistances</li>\n<li>Possess no weaknesses</li>\n<li>Has no Attacks that possess the <Type></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Logistically, a Stellar-Type Pokémon has no Type-based weaknesses, though certain Moves and Abilities may allow separate increases in effectiveness.</p>\n<h1>Shadow Pokémon</h1>\n<p><strong>Shadow Pokémon</strong> are an unnatural phenomenon; the result of a Pokémon closing off its heart due to natural or artificial means. They are incredibly distrustful of people, and have been known to Attack anything unprovoked, including their own trainers. Though strong, they are stuck in a state where growth is impossible. Caution to any trainer that obtains one of these beasts.</p>\n<h2>Unique Traits and General Rules</h2>\n<p>Shadow Pokémon, as a result of the mechanism or phenomenon that granted them the Shadow Type, have had their “hearts shut”, transforming them into soulless fighting machines. Shadow Pokémon are creatures that possess the special <strong>[Closed Heart]</strong> Trait, which confers a number of effects and mechanics unique to them, which also include unusual behaviors and other qualities that GMs can utilize at their discretion.</p>\n<p>Shadow Pokémon are special Pokémon that are strong in their own right, but this strength comes at the cost of their ability to grow like other Pokémon. There are a few key rules that accompany the [Closed Heart] trait:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>These creatures have their SPD Stat (before combat effects) increased by 50%.</li>\n<li>These creatures possess the <em>Extra Abilities</em> \"Hyper Aggressive\" and \"Coldhearted.\"</li>\n<li>They must have two (2) [Shadow] <Type> Attacks on their Active List at all times, but gain an extra slot in their Active List.</li>\n<li>The creatures grow more slowly, being placed onto a slower experience track, shown in the \"Closed Heart Experience Tracks\" section, below.</li>\n<li>These creatures add Shadow-Type Attacks to their Attack Repetoire as part of leveling, selected as though they were being Tutored. This allocation is shpwn in the \"Closed Heart Leveling Learnlist\" section, below.</li>\n<li>Possess a unique Skill similar to Resources: “Anguish”, which governs the Shadow Pokemon’s resistance to Purification.</li>\n<li>Are susceptible to entering Hyper Mode, a unique Minor Affliction.</li>\n<li>They cannot utilize Evolution, or undergo miscellaneous transforms (Transform, Phenomena, etc.).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Closed Heart Experience Tracks</p>\n<p>EXPPkmn=34LevelCurrent3EXP _{Pkmn} \\normalsize = \\large\\frac{\\normalsize 3}{\\normalsize 4} {Level_{Current}}^3 EXPPkmn​=43​LevelCurrent​3</p>\n<p>EXPHmnoid=53LevelCurrent3EXP _{Hmnoid} \\normalsize = \\large\\frac{\\normalsize 5}{\\normalsize 3} {Level_{Current}}^3 EXPHmnoid​=35​LevelCurrent​3</p>\n<p>Closed Heart Leveling Learnlist</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th id=\"level\">Level</th>\n<th id=\"num._of_attacks\">Num. of Attacks</th>\n<th id=\"max_grade\">Max Grade</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<pre><code>| 1 | x2 | E |\n</code></pre>\n<p>| 5 | x1 | D |<br />\n| 10 | x2 | D |<br />\n| 15 | x3 | C |<br />\n| 20 | x1 | B |<br />\n| 25 | x2 | B |<br />\n| 30 | x3 | B |<br />\n| 35 | x1 | A |<br />\n| 40 | x2 | A |<br />\n| 45 | x2 | A |<br />\n| 50 | x2 | S |<br />\n| 55 | x1 | S |<br />\n| 60 | x1 | S+ |<br />\n| 65 | x1 | S+ |<br />\n| 70 | x1 | S+ |<br />\n| 75 | x1 | S+ |<br />\n| 80 | x1 | S+ |<br />\n| 85 | x1 | S+ |<br />\n| 90 | x1 | S+ |<br />\n| 95 | x1 | S+ |<br />\n| 100 | x1 | S+ |</p>\n<h2>Hyper Mode</h2>\n<p>Hyper Mode is a Status Condition only able to be gained by [Closed Heart]. Hyper Mode occurs when the normally-composed and obedient [Closed Heart] loses that composure and its burgeoning emotions flare up and bubble over, causing its aggression to explode.</p>\n<p>A Pokémon has a chance to gain Hyper Mode after resolving a Shadow-Type Attack. The creature makes a Trivial Anguish Test, with the DC reduced by their Natural Tension times 5. If the creature rolls above the DC, they gain Hyper Mode.</p>\n<p>In addition to the 5% chance to be cured of Hyper Mode at the start of their Activations, creatures may be cured by another creature’s “Call!” Action, and may be cured freely as part of a Camp Action.</p>\n<h2>The Shadow Type</h2>\n<p>The <strong>[Shadow] <Type></strong> is an odd Type. It possesses neutral resistance to all other base Types, and is super effective against all other Types. It only exists on Attacks and some other Actions — it cannot be possessed by a creature as one of that creature’s Typings.</p>\n<p>Shadow-Type Attacks are quite brutal in their nature, and the costs of their raw power is surprisingly minimal. Naming-wise, Shadow-Type Attacks have very decisive-sounding names, brutal and “safe” edgy.</p>\n<p>Generally, Shadow-Type Attacks possess two intrinsic properties that differentiate them from other Attacks:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>They are copies or Type-Shifts of existing Attacks.</li>\n<li>They possess a reduced (usually halved) PP Cost.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Purification</h2>\n<p>Similar to Luck, [Closed Heart] creatures have the unique metacurrency/metaskill: <strong><em>Anguish</em></strong>. Upon gaining [Closed Heart], Anguish is set at 100. Through interacting with a caring partner and companions that appeal to their true nature, the creature’s Anguish is reduced. Upon hitting zero and taking part in a “Purification Ceremony” Downtime Action, the creature loses [Closed Heart] and gains [Triumphant]. Upon losing [Closed Heart], the creature loses all of the Shadow-Type Attacks it previously possessed alongside the other mechanics and benefits associated with the Trait.</p>\n<p>There are a number of methods to reduce Anguish:</p>\n<h3>Exiting Hyper Mode</h3>\n<p>When the creature is cured of Hyper Mode, their Anguish is reduced by the following:</p>\n<p>AnguishHyper=2d2Anguish_{Hyper} = 2d2 AnguishHyper​=2d2</p>\n<h4>Positive Social Interactions</h4>\n<p>Certain social interactions (such as urging the creature to play with their comrades, participate in a social gathering, etc.) also allow for Anguish to decrease.</p>\n<p>The creature (or one creature among the group) working with the [Closed Heart] creature must make a <strong>Hard Skill Test</strong> using a Skill pertinent to the situation and interaction.</p>\n<h3>Reducing Anguish</h3>\n<p>The creature’s Anguish is reduced (or possibly increased) by:</p>\n<p>AnguishSocial=4+2∗DoS−RapportNaturalAnguish_{Social} = 4+2*DoS-Rapport_{Natural} AnguishSocial​=4+2∗DoS−RapportNatural​</p>\n<h4>After Combat</h4>\n<p>Success in overcoming tough opponents always strengthens the bonds between comrades.</p>\n<p>After participating in Combat, the creature makes a <strong>Challenging Anguish Test</strong>. The creature's Anguish decreases/increases by:</p>\n<p>AnguishCombat=2∗DoS+TensionNaturalAnguish_{Combat} = 2*DoS+Tension_{Natural} AnguishCombat​=2∗DoS+TensionNatural​</p>\n<h4>Nightly Care</h4>\n<p>While at Camp, a creature can try to care for the [Closed Heart] creature, working to open the door to its heart.</p>\n<p>The creature (or one creature among the group) caring for the [Closed Heart] creature makes a <strong>Challenging Husbandry Test</strong> as part of a Downtime Action. The creature’s Anguish is reduced/increased by:</p>\n<p>AnguishCombat=3∗DoS+TensionNat−RapportNatAnguish_{Combat} = 3*DoS+Tension_{Nat}-Rapport_{Nat} AnguishCombat​=3∗DoS+TensionNat​−RapportNat​</p>\n<h4>Applying Cologne</h4>\n<p>When applying a [Cologne] item, reduce the target’s Anguish by the amount listed in item’s text.</p>\n<h4>Special Intervention</h4>\n<p>In specific scenarios, a [Legendary] Pokémon, a creature with [Shadow Purification], or some other magical or technological force can intervene and aid in the reduction of the creature’s Anguish.

In this way, they’re essentially the midpoint between regional variants and the Paradox Pokémon.</p>\n<p>Like regional variants, Deltas had a similar surge in the fan community after their introduction, leading to a ton of creative works in their wake, most notably coalescing into the roster of Delta Pokémon introduced in the Pokémon Insurgence fan-game.</p>\n<p>Delta Pokémon, for all intents and purposes, are just more exotic regional variants that are generally unnatural-looking, and are frequently more battle-capable than their original version. The lore for them in both the TCG and in Insurgence dictates them being anomalous and rare. It is recommended that should GMs utilize Delta Species Pokémon, they do so understanding their fairly unusual position relative to other Pokémon, and should utilize them considering possible ramifications to their campaign setting and story and possible in-combat balance.</p>\n<h1>Nuclear Type</h1>\n<p>The <strong>Nuclear Type</strong> is a <Type> introduced in the fan-game Pokémon Uranium.

While less mechanically-involved than Shadow Pokémon, Nuclear is also potentially campaign- and balance-warping.</p>",
        "markdown": "While each region in the mainline Pokémon games has their own unique quirks and mechanics, Generation 6 introduced Mega Evolution, which proved to be the first of the trend of GameFreak introducing a new overarching mechanic each generation from then onwards. Because of the tendency to introduce them one generation and deemphasize or remove them in the next, it’s more prudent to call these mechanics, collectively, “Regional Phenomena”, or just **Phenomena** for short. _Things related to these Phenomena will possess the \\[Phenomenon\\] Trait_.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of allowing flexibility and options for all campaigns and groups, we are choosing to include specific rules for the Phenomena observed in the mainline series, with the door open to explore those introduced in side games or fan-made games later on.\r\n\r\nHowever, because they are “regional”, _it is advised that GMs use their discretion in making these mechanics available to their campaign_. The introduction of many of these items can heavily sway the power and narrative balance of a campaign, especially since all of them are narratively powerful in their source materials and, for the most part. The flavor provided for these mechanics are a guideline, but not a hard and fast ruleset.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of Pokémon Tabletop Evolved, the Phenomena we support as core are as follows:\r\n\r\n-   _Mega Evolution_ (first introduced in *Pokémon X* and *Pokémon Y*)\r\n-   _Z-Moves_ (first introduced in *Pokémon Sun* and *Pokémon Moon*)\r\n-   _Dynamax_ (first introduced in *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield*)\r\n-   _Terastal Phenomenon_ (first introduced in *Pokémon Scarlet* and *Pokémon Violet*)\r\n-   _Shadow Pokemon_ (first introduced in *Pokémon Colosseum* and refined in *Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness*)\r\n-   _Delta Species_ (first introduced in the *Pokémon Trading Card Game*’s “EX Delta Species” set and expounded upon in fan-games preceding Gen 7, most notably *Pokémon Insurgence*)\r\n-   _Nuclear Type_ (introduced and popularized by the fan-game *Pokémon Uranium*)\r\n\r\n# Mega Evolution\r\n\r\n**Mega Evolution** is a type of transformation that Pokémon can undergo, operating as a temporary evolution rather than a more standard Forme Change. Broadly speaking, fully evolved Pokémon (and those without any evolutions) are capable of Mega Evolving. While certain extraordinary situations can trigger Mega Evolution for a time, the most reliable method is through the use of a set of Accessories, worn by a Pokémon and a trusted partner. The Pokémon must hold a **Mega Stone** with which it shares a <Species> Keyword, and the partner must possess a **Key Stone**, which is a Held Item that can be slotted into another piece of gear.\r\n\r\nFollowing the example of the official and many fan-made Mega Evolutions, this Phenomena acts much the same, but with tweaks to suit the modified approach to Pokémon builds. Similar to the way the more radical Forme Changes are handled, Mega Pokémon are classified as a separate <Species>, which provide:\r\n\r\n-   A different set of characteristics and Traits (usually expansions on what the creature originally had)\r\n-   An Extra Ability\r\n-   A different default Skill spread\r\n-   100 points spread out among the Pokémon’s Base Stats except for HP.\r\n\r\nThe Ability gained from Mega Evolution is always added as an _Extra Ability_ and doesn’t replace any Abilities already possessed by the Pokémon, However, in the scenario that a Pokémon already possesses the Extra Ability from another source, the Extra Ability provided by Mega Evolution is instead changed to one of the Starting, Basic, Advanced, Master Abilities it does not have active (user’s choice).\r\n\r\nMega Evolution may be initialized on either the Pokémon’s or its partner’s activation, via the “_Mega Evolve!_” Action. If either entity Faints before the Action resolves, the Pokémon does not Mega Evolve. Once successfully resolved, Mega Evolution lasts for the remainder of a combat, even if the user Faints. The Pokémon partner can alternatively disengage the Mega Evolution using the “_Power Down!_” action. A Key Stone can only Mega Evolve one Pokémon during a combat.\r\n\r\nOut of combat, a Pokémon may be Mega Evolved for up to a single Daytime Span, and may be de-Evolved early through the use of “Power Down!”. If the Mega Evolved Pokémon enters combat after Mega Evolving ahead of time, they are de-Evolved at the end of the combat. When a Pokémon Mega Evolves out of combat, they gain one Stack of Weary upon de-Evolving.\r\n\r\nThe Key Stone’s **PP Pool** can be used for the cost of “Mega Evolve!”, and any subsequent uses must be consumed by the player. The Key Stone has its PP Pool refilled during the Rest Action.\r\n\r\nWhile Mega Evolved, the Pokémon’s Mega Stone is absorbed into their body, meaning the item no longer occupies an Equipment Slot and cannot be taken from the user through the use of other creatures’ Actions and Abilities.\r\n\r\n# Z-Moves\r\n\r\nA **Zenith Move** (shortened to **Z-Move**) is a special type of Attack, in which a Pokémon and their partner’s wishes combine to unleash an Attack comprising the full power of both creatures. The partner focuses their will into an Accessory Item known as a Zenith Core, which magnifies and transmits ambient **Z-Power** into s **Z-Crystal** or **Z-Power-Crystal** that the Pokémon has equipped as an accessory, allowing the Pokemon to transform one of its Moves into a powerful Z-Move.\r\n\r\nDuring their Activation, the Pokémon’s partner can use the “_Z-Pose!_” Action to trigger the activation of a Z-Move that meets the criteria of the held Z-Crystal/Z-Power-Crystal. If either entity Faints before the Action resolves, the Action’s PP Cost is spent, but the effect fails to resolve. A Zenith Core can only power one Z-Move during a Combat. Zenith Cores recharge after a Combat resolves, and can be used during the next Combat.\r\n\r\nStandard Z-Crystals allow for the activation of the **\\[Zenith\\]** Attack associated with the <Type> of the Z-Crystal, provided the user has an Attack of that Type on their Active List. Physical- and Special-Category Attacks allow for one of the Type-Specific Z-Moves, and Status-Category Moves allow for the use of the Attack \"Zenith Power.\" Z-Power-Crystals, on the other hand, allow for certain Pokemon Species (and the members of their evolutionary lines) to use specific Z-Moves so long as they have a specific Attack on their Active List.\r\n\r\n# Dynamax\r\n\r\n**Dynamax** is a type of special physical transformation Pokémon can undergo, warping the space around them to change their size and affect the world around them, using the incredible power stored within a **Wishing Star**. Two prerequisites must be met before Dynamax can be applied to a Pokémon, however. First, the Pokémon’s partner must be Holding a Wishing Star or be wearing an Accessory Slot item containing a Wishing Star. Second, the Wishing Star must have accumulated enough energy to engage in the process. However, certain extraordinary situations can trigger Dynamaxes for a time, sometimes nearly indefinitely, sometimes involuntarily.\r\n\r\nDuring their Activation, the Pokémon’s partner can use the “_Max Lob!_” Action to Dynamax the Pokémon, or the Pokémon may use “_Become Giant!_” to Dynamax itself. If either entity Faints before the Action resolves, the Pokémon does not Dynamax, and the Wishing Star does not lose its charge, but the PP used for “Max Lob!” or “Become Giant!” is still consumed. Once successfully resolved, a Pokémon remains Dynamaxed for 5 Activations, and loses it prematurely if they Faint. The Pokémon’s partner can alternatively disengage Dynamax using the “Power Down!” action. A Wishing Star can only Dynamax one Pokémon during a combat.\r\n\r\nWhen a Pokémon Dynamaxes, it immediately grows to a truly large size: Medium and smaller Pokémon have their Size Category set to \"Titanic,\" and Large and larger Pokémon have their Size Category set to \"Max.\" Creatures that would be within the Dynamaxed Pokémon’s space are then pushed to the nearest unoccupied space that is not adjacent to the Dynamaxed Pokémon. If the Dynamaxed Pokémon would not be able to fit in the space around it at the end of this transformation, the user either shapes the area around it so it can occupy the space (often destroying objects and terrain), or is forcefully moved to a space it can safely occupy. This is done at the discretion of the GM.\r\n\r\nWhile Dynamaxed, a Pokémon:\r\n\r\n-   _Has its HP stat, after all other modifiers, doubled, and has its current HP set to the same percent it was at before Dynamaxing_ (rounded up)\r\n-   _Has all of its Movement Score increase by 10% per Size Category increase_ (so a Large Pokémon gains 50% to all of its Movement Types, while a Huge Pokémon gains 30%).\r\n-   _Has all of the Attacks on the their Active List temporarily replaced with **\\[Max\\]** Attacks while Dynamaxed_, which are provided based on the what is on their Active List prior to Dynamaxing:\r\n    -   \"Max Struggle,\" which replaces \"Struggle\"\r\n    -   \"Max Guard,\" which replaces all Status-Category Attacks.\r\n    -   <Type> \\[Max\\] Attacks, which are added corresponding to the <Type> of the Physical- and Special-Category Attacks Pokémon’s Active List\r\n    -   \"G-Max\" Attacks, if the Pokémon meets the Active List <Type> and <Species> requirement for those specific \\[Max\\] Attacks\r\n\r\nThe partner's Wishing Star’s **PP Pool** can be used for the cost of “_Become Giant!_”, and any subsequent uses must be consumed by the Pokémon using \"_Become Giant!_.\"\r\n\r\n> _Development Note_: mechanics regarding the recharge/replenishment of the Wishing Star are still forthcoming.\r\n\r\n# Terastal Phenomenon\r\n\r\n**Terastallization** is a type of enhancement and transformation that affects a Pokémon, blinging it out in a massive jewel and giving it extraordinary elemental power. Two prerequisites must be met before a Pokémon can Terastallize: a Pokémon's partner possesses a Held Item called a **Tera Orb**, and the Tera Orb must have accumulated enough energy to initiate and sustain the phenomenon.\r\n\r\nDuring their Activation, the partner creature can use the “_Crystal Pitch!_” Action to Terastallize the Pokémon. If either entity Faints before the Action resolves, the Pokémon does not Terastallize , and the Tera Orb does not lose its charge, but the PP used for “Crystal Pitch!” is still consumed. Once successfully resolved, the Pokémon is Terastallized until combat ends and loses it prematurely if they Faint. The Pokémon’s partner can alternatively disengage the Terastal Phenomenon using the “_Power Down!_” action.\r\n\r\nWhen a Pokémon Terastallizes, its Typing is completely overridden to its **Tera Type**. A Pokémon’s Tera Type is defined through a <Tera Type> Trait denoting which Tera <Type> it has. The Tera Type for a Pokémon is usually its inherent Type(s), but through special means a Pokémon can have a different Tera Type or be given a new one. When generated or caught, a Pokémon has an 80% chance for its Tera Type to be one of its default Type(s), and 20% to be any other base Type, including the Stellar-Type. GMs including Types beyond the original 18 and Stellar (such as Nuclear and Shadow) can choose to allow Pokémon to have Tera Types beyond the standard 18+1.\r\n\r\nTrainers with Type Sync can change a Pokémon’s Tera Type to match the Type(s) they have access to through Type Sync.\r\n\r\nWhile Terastilized, a Pokémon:\r\n\r\n-   _Cannot have its <Type>ing changed from its Tera Type_\r\n-   _Continues to receive STAB for its original <Type>s_\r\n-   _Receives an extra STAB for its <Tera Type>_\r\n    -   If the <Tera Type> is the same as one of the original <Type>s, this STAB doubles up.\r\n\r\n> _Development Note_: tenatively, we are **_not_** including the \"minimum Attack Power is 60\" effect from the mainline games.\r\n\r\nThe partner's Tera Orb’s **PP Pool** can be used for the cost of “_Crystal Pitch!_”, and any subsequent uses must be consumed by the Pokémon targetted by \"_Crystal Pitch!_.\"\r\n\r\n> _Development Note_: mechanics regarding the recharge/replenishment of the Tera Orb are still forthcoming.\r\n\r\n## Stellar-Type\r\n\r\nWhen a Pokémon Terastallizes into the **Stellar-Type**, it:\r\n\r\n-   _Still receives STAB for its original <Types>_\r\n-   _Gains a one-time extra STAB bonus for every Type_.\r\n    -   Once the Pokémon uses a Move of a given Type, it loses that extra STAB for that Type for the remainder of their Terastilization.\r\n\r\nThe \\[Stellar\\] <Type>:\r\n\r\n-   Possess no resistances\r\n-   Possess no weaknesses\r\n-   Has no Attacks that possess the <Type>\r\n\r\nLogistically, a Stellar-Type Pokémon has no Type-based weaknesses, though certain Moves and Abilities may allow separate increases in effectiveness.\r\n\r\n# Shadow Pokémon\r\n\r\n**Shadow Pokémon** are an unnatural phenomenon; the result of a Pokémon closing off its heart due to natural or artificial means. They are incredibly distrustful of people, and have been known to Attack anything unprovoked, including their own trainers. Though strong, they are stuck in a state where growth is impossible. Caution to any trainer that obtains one of these beasts.\r\n\r\n## Unique Traits and General Rules\r\n\r\nShadow Pokémon, as a result of the mechanism or phenomenon that granted them the Shadow Type, have had their “hearts shut”, transforming them into soulless fighting machines. Shadow Pokémon are creatures that possess the special **\\[Closed Heart\\]** Trait, which confers a number of effects and mechanics unique to them, which also include unusual behaviors and other qualities that GMs can utilize at their discretion.\r\n\r\nShadow Pokémon are special Pokémon that are strong in their own right, but this strength comes at the cost of their ability to grow like other Pokémon. There are a few key rules that accompany the \\[Closed Heart\\] trait:\r\n\r\n1.  These creatures have their SPD Stat (before combat effects) increased by 50%.\r\n2.  These creatures possess the _Extra Abilities_ \"Hyper Aggressive\" and \"Coldhearted.\"\r\n3.  They must have two (2) \\[Shadow\\] <Type> Attacks on their Active List at all times, but gain an extra slot in their Active List.\r\n4.  The creatures grow more slowly, being placed onto a slower experience track, shown in the \"Closed Heart Experience Tracks\" section, below.\r\n5.  These creatures add Shadow-Type Attacks to their Attack Repetoire as part of leveling, selected as though they were being Tutored. This allocation is shpwn in the \"Closed Heart Leveling Learnlist\" section, below.\r\n6.  Possess a unique Skill similar to Resources: “Anguish”, which governs the Shadow Pokemon’s resistance to Purification.\r\n7.  Are susceptible to entering Hyper Mode, a unique Minor Affliction.\r\n8.  They cannot utilize Evolution, or undergo miscellaneous transforms (Transform, Phenomena, etc.).\r\n\r\nClosed Heart Experience Tracks\r\n\r\nEXPPkmn\\=34LevelCurrent3EXP \\_{Pkmn} \\\\normalsize = \\\\large\\\\frac{\\\\normalsize 3}{\\\\normalsize 4} {Level\\_{Current}}^3 EXPPkmn​\\=43​LevelCurrent​3\r\n\r\nEXPHmnoid\\=53LevelCurrent3EXP \\_{Hmnoid} \\\\normalsize = \\\\large\\\\frac{\\\\normalsize 5}{\\\\normalsize 3} {Level\\_{Current}}^3 EXPHmnoid​\\=35​LevelCurrent​3\r\n\r\nClosed Heart Leveling Learnlist\r\n\r\n| Level | Num. of Attacks | Max Grade |\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\n\r\n```\r\n| 1 | x2 | E |\r\n```\r\n\r\n| 5 | x1 | D |  \r\n| 10 | x2 | D |  \r\n| 15 | x3 | C |  \r\n| 20 | x1 | B |  \r\n| 25 | x2 | B |  \r\n| 30 | x3 | B |  \r\n| 35 | x1 | A |  \r\n| 40 | x2 | A |  \r\n| 45 | x2 | A |  \r\n| 50 | x2 | S |  \r\n| 55 | x1 | S |  \r\n| 60 | x1 | S+ |  \r\n| 65 | x1 | S+ |  \r\n| 70 | x1 | S+ |  \r\n| 75 | x1 | S+ |  \r\n| 80 | x1 | S+ |  \r\n| 85 | x1 | S+ |  \r\n| 90 | x1 | S+ |  \r\n| 95 | x1 | S+ |  \r\n| 100 | x1 | S+ |\r\n\r\n## Hyper Mode\r\n\r\nHyper Mode is a Status Condition only able to be gained by \\[Closed Heart\\]. Hyper Mode occurs when the normally-composed and obedient \\[Closed Heart\\] loses that composure and its burgeoning emotions flare up and bubble over, causing its aggression to explode.\r\n\r\nA Pokémon has a chance to gain Hyper Mode after resolving a Shadow-Type Attack. The creature makes a Trivial Anguish Test, with the DC reduced by their Natural Tension times 5. If the creature rolls above the DC, they gain Hyper Mode.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the 5% chance to be cured of Hyper Mode at the start of their Activations, creatures may be cured by another creature’s “Call!” Action, and may be cured freely as part of a Camp Action.\r\n\r\n## The Shadow Type\r\n\r\nThe **\\[Shadow\\] <Type>** is an odd Type. It possesses neutral resistance to all other base Types, and is super effective against all other Types. It only exists on Attacks and some other Actions — it cannot be possessed by a creature as one of that creature’s Typings.\r\n\r\nShadow-Type Attacks are quite brutal in their nature, and the costs of their raw power is surprisingly minimal. Naming-wise, Shadow-Type Attacks have very decisive-sounding names, brutal and “safe” edgy.\r\n\r\nGenerally, Shadow-Type Attacks possess two intrinsic properties that differentiate them from other Attacks:\r\n\r\n1.  They are copies or Type-Shifts of existing Attacks.\r\n2.  They possess a reduced (usually halved) PP Cost.\r\n\r\n## Purification\r\n\r\nSimilar to Luck, \\[Closed Heart\\] creatures have the unique metacurrency/metaskill: **_Anguish_**. Upon gaining \\[Closed Heart\\], Anguish is set at 100. Through interacting with a caring partner and companions that appeal to their true nature, the creature’s Anguish is reduced. Upon hitting zero and taking part in a “Purification Ceremony” Downtime Action, the creature loses \\[Closed Heart\\] and gains \\[Triumphant\\]. Upon losing \\[Closed Heart\\], the creature loses all of the Shadow-Type Attacks it previously possessed alongside the other mechanics and benefits associated with the Trait.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of methods to reduce Anguish:\r\n\r\n### Exiting Hyper Mode\r\n\r\nWhen the creature is cured of Hyper Mode, their Anguish is reduced by the following:\r\n\r\nAnguishHyper\\=2d2Anguish\\_{Hyper} = 2d2 AnguishHyper​\\=2d2\r\n\r\n#### Positive Social Interactions\r\n\r\nCertain social interactions (such as urging the creature to play with their comrades, participate in a social gathering, etc.) also allow for Anguish to decrease.\r\n\r\nThe creature (or one creature among the group) working with the \\[Closed Heart\\] creature must make a **Hard Skill Test** using a Skill pertinent to the situation and interaction.\r\n\r\n### Reducing Anguish\r\n\r\nThe creature’s Anguish is reduced (or possibly increased) by:\r\n\r\nAnguishSocial\\=4+2∗DoS−RapportNaturalAnguish\\_{Social} = 4+2\\*DoS-Rapport\\_{Natural} AnguishSocial​\\=4+2∗DoS−RapportNatural​\r\n\r\n#### After Combat\r\n\r\nSuccess in overcoming tough opponents always strengthens the bonds between comrades.\r\n\r\nAfter participating in Combat, the creature makes a **Challenging Anguish Test**. The creature's Anguish decreases/increases by:\r\n\r\nAnguishCombat\\=2∗DoS+TensionNaturalAnguish\\_{Combat} = 2\\*DoS+Tension\\_{Natural} AnguishCombat​\\=2∗DoS+TensionNatural​\r\n\r\n#### Nightly Care\r\n\r\nWhile at Camp, a creature can try to care for the \\[Closed Heart\\] creature, working to open the door to its heart.\r\n\r\nThe creature (or one creature among the group) caring for the \\[Closed Heart\\] creature makes a **Challenging Husbandry Test** as part of a Downtime Action. The creature’s Anguish is reduced/increased by:\r\n\r\nAnguishCombat\\=3∗DoS+TensionNat−RapportNatAnguish\\_{Combat} = 3\\*DoS+Tension\\_{Nat}-Rapport\\_{Nat} AnguishCombat​\\=3∗DoS+TensionNat​−RapportNat​\r\n\r\n#### Applying Cologne\r\n\r\nWhen applying a \\[Cologne\\] item, reduce the target’s Anguish by the amount listed in item’s text.\r\n\r\n#### Special Intervention\r\n\r\nIn specific scenarios, a \\[Legendary\\] Pokémon, a creature with \\[Shadow Purification\\], or some other magical or technological force can intervene and aid in the reduction of the creature’s Anguish. Taking a Downtime Action with aid of a \\[Legendary\\] Pokémon or beneficent force reduces the creature’s Anguish by half the aiding creature/source’s Level, automatically performing a Purification Ceremony if it hits 0.\r\n\r\n### Purified Creatures\r\n\r\n\\[Triumphant\\] creatures gain the following bonuses:\r\n\r\n-   The \"Purifier\" Ability, provided freely.\r\n-   Their Level Track is returned to normal, and their Level is increased to the Level determined by their accumulated experience.\r\n-   The creature adds 1+ Level/10 Tutor Attacks that they qualify for to their Repertoire, which is retroactive and applies as they continue to grow.\r\n-   These creatures get access to Luck, and may use Luck as Players and Aces do. Instead of recovering 1d10 Luck at the end of session, they only recover 1d4 Luck.\r\n\r\n### Special Shadow Pokémon\r\n\r\nCertain \\[Closed Heart\\] creatures may have their hearts bound tighter in order to maintain their immense power, or maybe their capabilities as a Shadow Pokémon are simply beyond the pale. Or maybe they’re particularly unique Shadow Pokémon, having undergone a revolutionary process to give them power or make them extremely difficult to Purify.\r\n\r\nAs further options, encountered \\[Closed Heart\\] creatures may also possess the **\\[Apex\\]** or **\\[XD\\]** Traits. **\\[Apex\\]** is designed to be possessed by certain particularly powerful Shadow Pokémon, such as the Cipher Admins’ signature Shadow Pokémon in Colosseum and Gale of Darkness. **\\[XD\\]** meanwhile, would be possessed by exemplary, nigh-on perfect fighting machines like the Lugia in Gale of Darkness: XD-001.\r\n\r\nThe \\[Apex\\] Trait confers the following:\r\n\r\n1.  A calculative Level increase of +10.\r\n2.

A calculative Level increase of +30.\r\n2.

In this way, they’re essentially the midpoint between regional variants and the Paradox Pokémon.\r\n\r\nLike regional variants, Deltas had a similar surge in the fan community after their introduction, leading to a ton of creative works in their wake, most notably coalescing into the roster of Delta Pokémon introduced in the Pokémon Insurgence fan-game.\r\n\r\nDelta Pokémon, for all intents and purposes, are just more exotic regional variants that are generally unnatural-looking, and are frequently more battle-capable than their original version. The lore for them in both the TCG and in Insurgence dictates them being anomalous and rare. It is recommended that should GMs utilize Delta Species Pokémon, they do so understanding their fairly unusual position relative to other Pokémon, and should utilize them considering possible ramifications to their campaign setting and story and possible in-combat balance.\r\n\r\n# Nuclear Type\r\n\r\nThe **Nuclear Type** is a <Type> introduced in the fan-game Pokémon Uranium. There are a number of Pokémon exclusive to Uranium that possess the \\[Nuclear\\] <Type> innately, and have pertinent Attacks and Abilities.\r\n\r\nUnlike standard types, Nuclear possesses similar corruptive properties to Shadow Pokémon. Regular Pokémon that are exposed to an undue amount of radiation will become corrupted and feral, turning a different color and gain the Trait \\[Contaminated\\]. Unlike \\[Closed Heart\\], however, those who have become corrupted can evolve and undergo miscellaneous transformations.\r\n\r\n\\[Contaminated\\] creatures simply gain the \\[Nuclear\\] Type. Through special mechanical processes, generally through working with special scientists or being a skilled scientist yourself, \\[Contaminated\\] can be cured and the creature returned to their normal state.\r\n\r\nUnlike the Shadow-Type, the Nuclear-Type functions much more like a normal Typing. Offensively, Nuclear Attacks are super effective on all standard Types except Steel and Nuclear itself. Defensively, Nuclear is weak to all other Types and resists itself. As is evident, Nuclear is simultaneously very dangerous but also extremely volatile, making \\[Nuclear\\] Pokémon more prone to being glass cannons.\r\n\r\nWe recommend GMs exercise caution with making Nuclear-Type available in their campaign. While less mechanically-involved than Shadow Pokémon, Nuclear is also potentially campaign- and balance-warping.",

WC is calculated (evenutally automatically) based on the total weight of a creature, plus its equipped items.\n\nFor the below chart, a creature's WC is determined based on the first weight threshold it meets, starting from WC 1.\n\n<details>\n  <summary> Weight Class Thresholds </summary>\n\n| Weight Class | Weight Threshold (kg) | Weight Class | Weight Threshold (kg) |\n| :-----: | :------: | :-----: | :------: |\n| **1** | < 10 | **9** | < 120 |\n| **2** | < 20 | **10** | < 145 |\n| **3** | < 30 | **11** | < 190 |\n| **4** | < 40 | **12** | < 240 |\n| **5** | < 55 | **13** | < 305 |\n| **6** | < 70 | **14** | < 350 |\n| **7** | < 85 | **15** | < 410 |\n| **8** | < 100 | **16** | >= 410 |\n\n</details>\n\n# Size\n**Size** is what determines the actual dimensions of a creature’s token on a tactical map and all other associated mechanics.\n\n### Size Category Determination\nA creature’s \"Base Height\" (the one listed on the Actor's Sheet) is modified depending on how it’s measured, either being measured by the creature’s _length_ (like a snake or a fish) or a creature’s withers/shoulders (like dogs or horses). Certain creatures, like many Legendary Pokemon, or strangely bulky Pokemon, are usually measured as _quadrupeds_. These are listed on a creature's Species Item as `height`, `length` and `quad`. \n\nWith this, when determining a creature's Size Category, the creature's \"Base Height\" is multiplied via the below formulae, which is then compared to the different Height Thresholds for the Size Categories.\n  \n$\n\\large Height_{Length} = \\Large{\\frac{Height_{Base}}{\\sqrt{2}+1/4}} \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\; \\large Height_{Quad} = Height_{Base} * \\Large{\\frac{3+2*\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{5}}{4}}\n$\n\nTo determine a creature’s Size, based on the below table:\n1. Start at Diminutive.\n2. If height is less than the upper thresholds for that Size Category, the creature is that size. If not, go to the next Size Category.\n3. Repeat Step 2 until you find the creature’s suitable size.\n\nCreatures may only be at most *Titanic* in Size naturally.\n  \nThe table, below, lists **Size Category** determinations for creatures based on the value listed on their Actor Sheet (which is, by default, the Species' average).\n\n<details>\n  <summary> Size Category Determinations Table </summary>\n  \n  | Size Category | Height Threshold | Effective Height Threshold (Length) | Effective Height Threshold (Quad) |\n  | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: |\n  | _**Diminutive**_ | < 0.3048 | < 0.5073 | < 0.1512 |\n  | _**Tiny**_ | < 0.6858 | < 1.1413 | < 0.3402 |\n  | _**Small**_ | < 1.3208 | < 2.1981 | < 0.6551 |\n  | _**Medium**_ | < 3.048 | < 9.1305 | < 1.5118 |\n  | _**Large**_ | < 5.4864 | <10.5021 | < 2.7213 |\n  | _**Huge**_ | < 10.9728 | < 18.2611 | < 5.4425 |\n  | _**Gigantic**_ | < 16.4592 | < 27.3916 | < 8.1638 |\n  | _**Titanic**_ | - | - | - |\n  | _**Max**_ | - | - | - |\n  \n </details>\n \n## Size Category-Associated Mechanics\nSize Categories are involved with a number of other statistics and mechanics.\n\n<details>\n  <summary> Size Category Statistics Table </summary>\n  \n  | Size Category | Token Side Length (m) | Category Modifier (CatMod) | Reach (m) | Range Multiplier | Wide Line Width (m) |\n  | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: |\n  | _**Diminutive**_ | 1/4 | 0 | 1 | x1.00 | 2 |\n  | _**Tiny**_ | 1/2 | 1 | 1 | x1.00 | 2 |\n  | _**Small**_ | 3/4 | 2 | 1 | x1.00 | 3 |\n  | _**Medium**_ | 1 | 3 | 1 | x1.00 | 3 |\n  | _**Large**_ | 2 | 4 | 2 | x1.10 | 4 |\n  | _**Huge**_ | 3 | 5 | 3 | x1.20 | 4 |\n  | _**Gigantic**_ | 4 | 6 | 4 | x1.30 | 5 |\n  | _**Titanic**_ | 5 | 7 | 5 | x1.40 | 5 |\n  | _**Max**_ | 6 | 8 | 6 | x1.50 | 6 |\n  \n</details>\n  \n### Category Modifier\nThis value, numbering from 0 to 8, is associated with a number of other mechanics based off Size. To compare this to other systems, the **Category Modifier** is more akin to a \"Size Bonus\" or \"Size Rank\", in that it influences numbers and statistics elsewhere. This is referred to in other areas in the rules as a creature's **CatMod**, in shorthand.\n  \n### Token Size\nEach Actor has a specific token/actor size when placed onto the board, dependent on their Size Category. Each creature has a token side length of X metres, with Medium sized creatures having tokens that are 1m x 1m (generally, one square in size).\n\n### Reach\nA creature’s Reach (basically the length of its limbs) determines the Range of the creature’s [Contact] attacks. This value is  equal to:\n  \n$\n   Reach=max(CatMod-2, 1)\n$\n\n### Size-Based Range Increases\nThe Range of the user’s non-[Contact], non-Burst/Emanation attacks increase based on the creature’s size (due to greater output of energy, etc.), equal to:\n  \n$\n   Range_{Mult} = 1+\\Large\\frac{max(CatMod-3, 0)}{10}\n$\n\n### Wide Line Template\nThe width of the template for \"Wide Line\" attacks and effects is also dependent on a creature's Size Category, as follows:\n\n$\n   Width_{WL} = 2+\\big\\lfloor CatMod/2 \\big\\rfloor\n$\n\n### Size Increases to HP\nA creature’s HP calculation is modified by their Size Category, specifically their CatMod. Their **BulkMod** is expressed as:\n$\n   BulkMod= \\left(1+\\frac{e-1}{\\pi^3}\\right)^{CatMod}\n$\n\n### Differences in Accuracy\nCreatures have their accuracy affected by the difference in their Size Category vs their target's.\n- _User is 4 or more CatMod smaller_ (eg. Small vs Gigantic or larger): **+2 ACC stages**\n- _User is 2 or 3 CatMod smaller_ (eg. Medium vs Huge or Gigantic): **+1 ACC stages**\n- _User is 2 or 3 CatMod larger_ (eg. Medium vs Tiny or Diminutive): **-1 ACC stages**\n- _User is 4 or more CatMod larger_ (eg. Titanic vs Medium or smaller): **-2 ACC stacgs**",

        "content": "<p>Rolling for Skill Checks is fairly simple. The base Difficulty Check (<strong>DC</strong>) of the roll is equal to the level of the actor's relevant skill. The DC is further modified by the Challenge Rating (<strong>CR</strong>) applied by the current situation or circumstances. After finding the Final DC, the actor is aiming to <em>roll equal to or lower than the final result for a success</em>. Rolling higher than the final DC will result in a failure.</p>\n<p>For example, a player is attempting to conceal an item without anyone noticing. Their Sleight of Hand is at 60. For the sake of this section let's say nothing else hinders or helps the situation, giving a final DC of 60 for the roll. The player rolls a d100 Sleight of Hand roll and gets a 50, meaning they pass the check and are successful in concealing the item.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong><em>GM TIP</em></strong>: A good rule when deciding if something should be a skill check is to consider how often the situation can occur in day to day life. If the situation is a common enough occurrence, then a skill check is not required. You wouldn’t need to roll a check to open an unlocked door, but may need to roll a check to break a door down if it is locked or barricaded. Always use your best judgment when calling for a skill check.</p>\n  <p><strong><em>Foundry Tip:</em></strong> In foundry checks are rolled using the formula <code>1d100ms@dc</code>, which basically is the same as <code>d100-@dc</code>, but with a small twist, you may ask, what does <code>ms</code> stand for? Well it stands for 'Margin of Success' which the official Foundry KB Article describes as:</p>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>This modifier subtracts a target value set by the user from the result of the dice rolled, and returns difference as the final total. If the amount rolled is less than the target it outputs a negative number, and a positive number if there is a remainder after subtraction.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p>Basically what this means is that in the roll result you will always see the 'net' result, so if you have 40 in a skill, and roll a 35, the result will show <code>-5</code> as that is your 'Margin of Success'.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Challenge Rating</h2>\n<p>The Challenge Rating is a set of modifiers that increase or decrease the DC of a skill check. Things like weather, type of terrain, the action being attempted, etc. can alter how easy or how difficult a skill check can be. These modifiers are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Effortless</em>: <strong>+60</strong></li>\n<li><em>Trivial</em>: <strong>+50</strong></li>\n<li><em>Easy</em>: <strong>+40</strong></li>\n<li><em>Simple</em>: <strong>+30</strong></li>\n<li><em>Routine</em>: <strong>+20</strong></li>\n<li><em>Ordinary</em>: <strong>+10</strong></li>\n<li><em>Demanding</em>: <strong>no modifier</strong></li>\n<li><em>Taxing</em>: <strong>-10</strong></li>\n<li><em>Challenging</em>: <strong>-20</strong></li>\n<li><em>Difficult</em>: <strong>-30</strong></li>\n<li><em>Intense</em>: <strong>-40</strong></li>\n<li><em>Insane</em>: <strong>-50</strong></li>\n<li><em>Impossible</em>: <strong>-60</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>When deciding the Challenge Rating for a check, <em>consider how easy or difficult the situation may be for something without proper training than basing it off any individual character’s aptitude</em>. Many tasks people face during everyday life fall between Ordinary and Easy, but once you start looking at complicated or skill-determininate tasks or challenges, it can get hard.</p>\n<p>Such things </p>\n<p>During combat, most tests are considered to be Challenging at default.</p>\n<h2>Degree of Success</h2>\n<p>Many times, it is useful to know by how much you succeed, as if you superlatively succeed at a task in the dice, that should have a mechanical effect too! Success (and failure) can be measured by <strong>degrees</strong>. Basically, for every 10 points by which you exceed the DC of a skill test and succeed at a roll, you are considered to have an additional degree of success (DoS) on that skill test.</p>\n<p>Each additional degree of success should have some sort of impact on the magnitude of success to a skill test, so when you make a test to, say, leap across a raging, flooded river and its rocks, succeeding at a Acrobatics check by &lt;10 (1 DoS) would have you successfully do so, albeit very slowly. Succeeding by 53 (6 DoS) would have you clear the obstacle deftly, quickly, and avoiding getting your clothes wet! Or, perhaps, giving you the advantage to avoid possible debris or aggressive Pokemon also caught in the flood outright (where if you failed to make the jumps as fast, you’d have to make those subsequent tests too)!</p>\n<p>Certain Perks, Traits, Abilities, and Status Conditions may add or remove degrees of success/failure for certain skills, or even specific applications of a given skill.</p>\n<h2>Assistance</h2>\n<p>In some situations, multiple creatures working together can ensure success over a single creature attempting to do so by itself. If the GM agrees to the proposal, one or more creatures can assist another with a Test they are about to roll. When doing so, the creature with the highest Skill + Modifers makes rolls the Test, <strong>gaining +10 to the Test's DC per assisting creature</strong>.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Limitations</strong></em>:\nCreatures can generally assist each other in most tasks, but some leeway can be had, subject to GM approval:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Creatures assisting another must have at least 20 points invested in the utilized Skill.</li>\n<li>Usually, a creature needs to be adjacent to a creature it is Assisting.</li>\n<li>A creature may not be assisted by a number of creatures more than your <code>investedSkillPoints / 10</code>.</li>\n<li>Assisting creatures may opt to instead use <em>Teaching</em> in place of the Skill the rolling creature is using. When doing so, the assisting creature must have <strong>30 points invested in Teaching, and they only provide +5 to the Test's DC</strong>.</li>\n<li>A GM can elect to limit or outright prevent Assistance in extraordinary Tests or situations as they deem appropriate.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Luck</h1>\n<p><strong>Luck</strong> is representative of a \"cosmic karma\", one that guides a creature's favors and fortunes. Luck allows the manipulation of Skill Checks, and a few other aspects of the game. Luck is a resource that only Player Characters and Aces have, due to the \"plot importance\" these creatures tend to have, both in-game and out-of-game. At character creation, a Player determines their initial luck by rolling 3d6 and multiplying the result by 5.</p>\n<h2>Fortune</h2>\n<p>Whenever a creature fails a Skill Check, Accuracy Check, or Effect Check, they can spend a number of their Luck equal to how far off they were from succeeding to change it to a success. This means that if a player rolled a 45 on a DC 40 check, they can spend 5 luck to change it to a success.</p>\n<p>Fortune is not limited to changing a failure to a success. A player can also choose to increase the rols DoS by spending the amount of Luck needed. So like with the above example, you can spend 15 Luck instead to have it reach 30, or 2 DoS. And this can be done with naturally successful rolls too, like if you want to speed up the crafting of an item!</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When Luck is spent, the creatures’s Luck decreases depending on how it is spent. Luck many only be spent once per roll to affect it. And, crucially, Luck <em>can be spent on behalf of creatures you are considered to own or have as your trusted partners</em> - Pokémon or otherwise!\n  {.is-success}</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Push Your Luck</h2>\n<p>On a failed Skill Check, a player can choose to Push their Luck. This allows them to reroll the failed check, provided the player offers a way for the situation to worsen if they fail a second time. Luck cannot be spent on this reroll.</p>\n<h2>Devil's Deal</h2>\n<p>Also on a failed Skill Check, a player may also choose to take the \"Devil's Deal\". The player and the GM must agree for a way to make the failure much worse. In exchange however, the player gains luck as per the End of Session roll (below): gaining <code>d6+4</code> Luck for their troubles.</p>\n<h2>Lucky Break</h2>\n<p>In any game, Players may encounter a scenario where a Skill Check won’t give them the right answer, their own problem solving is letting them down, or they are simply rolling poorly. These are the times where a GM can offer a Lucky Break. This works the same as a Skill Check where the players roll a d100 Luck roll, using their current Luck as the DC. <em>Unlike normal Skill Checks, CR is not applied to a Lucky Break, and Players cannot spend Luck to alter the result of a Lucky Break, nor use Push Your Luck on this roll</em>.</p>\n<p>Now, this not an exhaustive list of uses. Other potential examples include: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Giving players a hint on how to solve a puzzle they have been stuck on. </li>\n<li>Having players to successfuly encounter Pokémon that they were searching for, perhaps even if they wouldn't normally find that Pokémon in that location (obviously, within reason).</li>\n<li>Rolling all sorts of \"whimsy\" rolls, such as seeing if players stumble across forage items in their stroll around town or during fast travel (provided, of course, the players aren't actively foraging!)</li>\n<li>And, perhaps importantly, a successful Lucky Break can reduce the CR of a Skill Check that the players feel they need to succeed on, even if they've been failing it repeatedly. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>There isn’t neccesarily a wrong way to use a Lucky Break, but we recommend using the mechanic sparingly or for when the session may start slowing down to a crawl or when all other options seem to be exhausted.</p>\n<p>When a Lucky Break is declared, any Player that agrees to take it rolls a combined Luck Check, each Player rolling Luck. At least 1 Player needs to agree to take a Lucky Break to continue. On a success, the GM grant that Player's Character some meta knowledge the GM feels is appropriate for them to use (or, in all scenarios outside of the GM nudging the party forward in meta sense, the GM should provide the situational or material reward they feel is appropriate for the current situation).</p>\n<p>For a combined group Luck Roll, count the number of successes, treating the player with the lowest Luck’s success twice. If the number of successes is greater than half the rolls made, the Lucky Break is treated as an overall success.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As a general rule, <em>do not penalize players for failing a Lucky Break roll</em>. Completely failing this just means they may need to rethink their approach or return when they are better prepared.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Recovering Luck</h2>\n<p>At the end of each session, Players roll a d100 with their current Luck as the DC, succeeding on a roll that is greater than or equal to the DC. On a success, they recover <del>1d10</del> <code>d6+4</code> Luck. <em>Players and Aces cannot have more than 100 Luck.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong><em>Dev Note</em></strong>: This does mean that players with lower Luck have a higher chance of recovering it at the end of a session. This is intended so players feel more incentive to spend Luck. In fact we encourage players to spend it as much as possible!</p>\n</blockquote>",

Other potential examples include: \n- Giving players a hint on how to solve a puzzle they have been stuck on. \n- Having players to successfuly encounter Pokémon that they were searching for, perhaps even if they wouldn't normally find that Pokémon in that location (obviously, within reason).\n- Rolling all sorts of \"whimsy\" rolls, such as seeing if players stumble across forage items in their stroll around town or during fast travel (provided, of course, the players aren't actively foraging!)\n- And, perhaps importantly, a successful Lucky Break can reduce the CR of a Skill Check that the players feel they need to succeed on, even if they've been failing it repeatedly. \n\nThere isn’t neccesarily a wrong way to use a Lucky Break, but we recommend using the mechanic sparingly or for when the session may start slowing down to a crawl or when all other options seem to be exhausted.\n\nWhen a Lucky Break is declared, any Player that agrees to take it rolls a combined Luck Check, each Player rolling Luck. At least 1 Player needs to agree to take a Lucky Break to continue. On a success, the GM grant that Player's Character some meta knowledge the GM feels is appropriate for them to use (or, in all scenarios outside of the GM nudging the party forward in meta sense, the GM should provide the situational or material reward they feel is appropriate for the current situation).\n\nFor a combined group Luck Roll, count the number of successes, treating the player with the lowest Luck’s success twice. If the number of successes is greater than half the rolls made, the Lucky Break is treated as an overall success.\n\n> As a general rule, _do not penalize players for failing a Lucky Break roll_. Completely failing this just means they may need to rethink their approach or return when they are better prepared.\n\n## Recovering Luck\n\nAt the end of each session, Players roll a d100 with their current Luck as the DC, succeeding on a roll that is greater than or equal to the DC. On a success, they recover ~~1d10~~ `d6+4` Luck. _Players and Aces cannot have more than 100 Luck._\n\n> **_Dev Note_**: This does mean that players with lower Luck have a higher chance of recovering it at the end of a session. This is intended so players feel more incentive to spend Luck. In fact we encourage players to spend it as much as possible!",

This could be convincing them to fight alongside you for a battle, allow themselves to be captured or recruited (in the case of Pokémon), hand over an item, flee, stand aside, stop fighting, or much more. These outcomes can be achieved through any skill that could reasonably convince the target of your goal, and the relevant skills can change throughout the negotiation if the method or situation calls for it.</p>\n<h3>Step 1: Identify the target’s Rapport &amp; Tension Clocks.</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Rapport</strong> indicates how difficult it is to build rapport, and convince the target to fulfill a request or follow a course of action. The higher the number, the harder it is to cause this outcome.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Tension</strong> indicates how difficult it is to develop tension, and cause the target to react poorly to your attempts at persuasion.

If this individual has had their Rapport or Tension clock permanently adjusted before, instead use those new values.</p>\n<p>When convincing more than one individual, instead consult the Crowd Table further below. Individuals in the crowd are not considered, nor are any permanent clock adjustments the individuals may have had. If this exact crowd has had their Rapport or Tension clock permanently adjusted before, though, instead use those new values. If even a single member is different, though, instead use the base values from the Crowd Table.</p>\n<h3>Step 2: Establish the goal and modify clocks.</h3>\n<p>Clarify what it is you want the target to do. Depending on how reasonable or absurd the action is, and how much it conflicts with the target’s personal goals, the Challenge Rating, Rapport, and Tension are all modified according to the Goal Table further below. If the goal is not within the table, the GM may use the closest approximate goal or come up with their own values to use. <em>Clocks may not be lowered below 1</em>.</p>\n<p>Goals may shift during persuasion without resetting the Rapport and Tension clocks. Some reasonable adjustments might be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“Pull that lever” -&gt; “Throw a rope around that lever to pull it” (Same general action)</li>\n<li>“Surrender” -&gt; “Flee” (Same result - the opponents lose the fight)</li>\n<li>“Hand me a Potion” -&gt; “Use a Potion on me” (Same item &amp; action cost)</li>\n<li>“Sell me that item at a 10% discount” -&gt; “Sell me that item at a 15% discount” (Same discount bracket)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, if the goal shifts too dramatically, the Rapport clock resets to its initial value. Note that this does not reset the Tension clock.</p>\n<p>Some dramatic adjustments might be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“Pull that lever” -&gt; “Prevent anyone from pulling that lever” (Opposite action)</li>\n<li>“Surrender” -&gt; “Join our side as allies” (Stronger outcome - the opponents become allies)</li>\n<li>“Hand me a Potion” -&gt; “Hand me a Super Potion” (Item of greater value)</li>\n<li>“Sell me that item at a 10% discount” -&gt; “Sell me that item at a 25% discount” (Higher discount bracket)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The GM has the final say on what adjustments are considered \"reasonable\" vs \"dramatic.\"</p>\n<h3>Step 3: Make appropriate Skill Checks depending on your goal.</h3>\n<p>As with other clocks, a Skill Check must be performed as a Complex Action to fill them. This Skill Check can be any relevant skill that the GM deems could reasonably move the target to act in the manner you wish. If the GM determines the chosen Skill and/or persuading mechanism is particularly appropriate (or inappropriate) given the situation, the Challenge Rating of the Skill Check may be modified too. Additionally, if a favor or gift is offered in exchange for the request the GM may choose to lower the Challenge Rating or even completely fill an additional Span if the gesture is meaningful enough. Conversely, taking actions the target would find unpleasant can have the opposite effect, increasing the Challenge Rating or filling a span of the Tension clock.</p>\n<p>Each successful Skill Check fills the Rapport clock by 1 Span, 2 if it is passed with 3+ DoS, and 3 if it is passed with 6+ DoS. The opportunity provided by a critical success may be used to fill 2 additional Spans.</p>\n<p>Conversely, each failed Skill Check fills the Tension clock by 1 Span, 2 Spans if it fails with 3+ DoF, and 3 Spans if it fails with 6+ DoF. The opportunity provided by a critical failure may be used to fill 2 additional Spans.</p>\n<h3>Step 4: Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Once a clock fills completely, the target acts accordingly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Rapport</strong>: The target follows the suggested course of action, becomes friendlier and easier to persuade in the future. The Rapport Clock for the target permanently lowers by 1, to a minimum of 3. The Tension Clock for the target permanently raises by 1. If the target was a crowd, only the collective group’s clock is affected, not the individuals who comprise it. Both clocks reset progress.</li>\n<li><strong>Tension</strong>: The target grows irritated, scared, bored, or otherwise displeased with the character(s) who put the course of action forward, potentially even becoming hostile. The Tension Clock for the target permanently lowers by 1, to a minimum of 3. The Rapport Clock for the target permanently raises by 1. Both Clocks reset progress.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em><strong>GM Note</strong></em>: In general, a target whose Tension clock was met should react in a narratively interesting way that does not align with the persuading character’s goals. A target being asked to instigate a fight with a third party may instead turn their ire on the persuading character. Inversely, a foe being talked down from a fight may comply, but then commit to a new action that antagonizes the persuading character further than battle itself, such as endangering a defenseless ally.</p>\n  <p>It’s also reasonable for the target to simply become bored and wander off, or even become frightened and flee if they were being spoken to roughly during an attempt to befriend them. Any outcome is valid, so long as it does not satisfy the persuading character’s wishes and simultaneously moves the story forward.\n  {.is-info}</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Skill Guidance</h2>\n<p>These are some examples of how Skill might be used in Social Encounters. <strong>This is not an exhaustive list, nor an exclusive one</strong>. We encourage GMs and players to find creative applications of skills as their scenarios demand.</p>\n<p><em>Conversation</em> - Used in general social interaction with an eye to using positive approaches to get what you want, such as persuading someone.</p>\n<p><em>Intimidate</em> - Used in negative social interactions to bully someone into giving you what you want.</p>\n<p><em>Negotiation</em> - Used to cut a deal with someone who is not interested in being persuaded, but can potentially be bought out. Used both 'offensively' and 'defensively'.</p>\n<p><em>Psychology</em> - Used to defend yourself from manipulation by others, through recognising behaviours. Opposes Conversation and Intimidate.</p>\n<h2>Player Persuasion (Optional)</h2>\n<p>At GM discretion, player characters may be persuaded just like any other character. This should be approached very carefully - robbing players of agency is a dangerous way to play, and can easily lead to resentment. If this is done, it should be heavily supported by the story, and not force a player to act in a way they detest. The targeted player may make a relevant Skill Check to lower their own Rapport clock or raise their own Tension clock. Each success lowers the Rapport clock by 1 Span, 2 for 3+ DoS, and 3 for 6+ DoS. Each failure lowers the Tension clock by 1 Span, 2 for 3+ DoF, and 3 for 6+ DoF. If the Rapport clock fills, the course of action must be followed to the spirit of the request, though the player’s clocks do not permanently adjust. If the Tension clock fills, the character may react however they like, and can not be persuaded again by the instigating character until after the next interlude.</p>\n<h1>Tables</h1>\n<h2>Natural

Note that this does not reset the Tension clock.\n\nSome dramatic adjustments might be:\n- “Pull that lever” -> “Prevent anyone from pulling that lever” (Opposite action)\n- “Surrender” -> “Join our side as allies” (Stronger outcome - the opponents become allies)\n- “Hand me a Potion” -> “Hand me a Super Potion” (Item of greater value)\n- “Sell me that item at a 10% discount” -> “Sell me that item at a 25% discount” (Higher discount bracket)\n\nThe GM has the final say on what adjustments are considered \"reasonable\" vs \"dramatic.\"\n\n### Step 3: Make appropriate Skill Checks depending on your goal.\nAs with other clocks, a Skill Check must be performed as a Complex Action to fill them. This Skill Check can be any relevant skill that the GM deems could reasonably move the target to act in the manner you wish. If the GM determines the chosen Skill and/or persuading mechanism is particularly appropriate (or inappropriate) given the situation, the Challenge Rating of the Skill Check may be modified too. Additionally, if a favor or gift is offered in exchange for the request the GM may choose to lower the Challenge Rating or even completely fill an additional Span if the gesture is meaningful enough. Conversely, taking actions the target would find unpleasant can have the opposite effect, increasing the Challenge Rating or filling a span of the Tension clock.\n\nEach successful Skill Check fills the Rapport clock by 1 Span, 2 if it is passed with 3+ DoS, and 3 if it is passed with 6+ DoS. The opportunity provided by a critical success may be used to fill 2 additional Spans.\n\nConversely, each failed Skill Check fills the Tension clock by 1 Span, 2 Spans if it fails with 3+ DoF, and 3 Spans if it fails with 6+ DoF. The opportunity provided by a critical failure may be used to fill 2 additional Spans.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nOnce a clock fills completely, the target acts accordingly:\n- **Rapport**: The target follows the suggested course of action, becomes friendlier and easier to persuade in the future. The Rapport Clock for the target permanently lowers by 1, to a minimum of 3. The Tension Clock for the target permanently raises by 1. If the target was a crowd, only the collective group’s clock is affected, not the individuals who comprise it. Both clocks reset progress.\n- **Tension**: The target grows irritated, scared, bored, or otherwise displeased with the character(s) who put the course of action forward, potentially even becoming hostile. The Tension Clock for the target permanently lowers by 1, to a minimum of 3. The Rapport Clock for the target permanently raises by 1. Both Clocks reset progress.\n\n> _**GM Note**_: In general, a target whose Tension clock was met should react in a narratively interesting way that does not align with the persuading character’s goals. A target being asked to instigate a fight with a third party may instead turn their ire on the persuading character. Inversely, a foe being talked down from a fight may comply, but then commit to a new action that antagonizes the persuading character further than battle itself, such as endangering a defenseless ally.\n> \n> It’s also reasonable for the target to simply become bored and wander off, or even become frightened and flee if they were being spoken to roughly during an attempt to befriend them. Any outcome is valid, so long as it does not satisfy the persuading character’s wishes and simultaneously moves the story forward.\n{.is-info}\n\n## Skill Guidance\nThese are some examples of how Skill might be used in Social Encounters. **This is not an exhaustive list, nor an exclusive one**. We encourage GMs and players to find creative applications of skills as their scenarios demand.\n\n_Conversation_ - Used in general social interaction with an eye to using positive approaches to get what you want, such as persuading someone.\n\n_Intimidate_ - Used in negative social interactions to bully someone into giving you what you want.\n\n_Negotiation_ - Used to cut a deal with someone who is not interested in being persuaded, but can potentially be bought out. Used both 'offensively' and 'defensively'.\n\n_Psychology_ - Used to defend yourself from manipulation by others, through recognising behaviours. Opposes Conversation and Intimidate.\n\n## Player Persuasion (Optional)\n\nAt GM discretion, player characters may be persuaded just like any other character. This should be approached very carefully - robbing players of agency is a dangerous way to play, and can easily lead to resentment. If this is done, it should be heavily supported by the story, and not force a player to act in a way they detest. The targeted player may make a relevant Skill Check to lower their own Rapport clock or raise their own Tension clock. Each success lowers the Rapport clock by 1 Span, 2 for 3+ DoS, and 3 for 6+ DoS. Each failure lowers the Tension clock by 1 Span, 2 for 3+ DoF, and 3 for 6+ DoF. If the Rapport clock fills, the course of action must be followed to the spirit of the request, though the player’s clocks do not permanently adjust. If the Tension clock fills, the character may react however they like, and can not be persuaded again by the instigating character until after the next interlude.\n\n# Tables\n## Natural Rapport and Tension Table\n**A creature's Natural Rapport and Tension are based on their Nature, and inform the baseline for each Social Stat's starting Social Clocks.**\n\n| NATURE | Rapport | Tension | NATURE | Rapport | Tension |\n| :-----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: |\n| **Cuddly** | 3 | 6 | **Distracted** | 6 | 6 |\n| **Proud** | 7 | 5 | **Decisive** | 3 | 3 |\n| **Patient** | 6 | 9 | **Desperate** | 3 | 6 |\n| **Lonely** | 5 | 6 | **Adamant** | 6 | 4 |\n| **Naughty** | 7 | 3 | **Brave** | 6 | 6 |\n| **Stark** | 6 | 4 | **Bold** | 4 | 4 |\n| **Impish** | 6 | 3 | **Lax** | 5 | 7 |\n| **Relaxed** | 4 | 7 | **Curious** | 5 | 8 |\n| **Modest** | 8 | 5 | **Mild** | 6 | 6 |\n| **Rash** | 5 | 3 | **Quiet** | 8 | 8 |\n| **Dreamy** | 7 | 8 | **Calm** | 4 | 7 |\n| **Gentle** | 3 | 6 | **Careful** | 8 | 6 |\n| **Sassy** | 8 | 5 | **Skittish** | 7 | 4 |\n| **Timid** | 7 | 6 | **Hasty** | 4 | 4 |\n| **Jolly** | 3 | 7 | **Naive** | 3 | 8 |\n| **Composed** | 6 | 6 | **Hardy** | 6 | 6 |\n| **Docile** | 3 | 9 | **Bashful** | 5 | 7 |\n| **Quirky** | 7 | 7 | **Serious** | 9 | 3 |\n\n## Crowd Table\n**These are the starting Social Clocks for influencing groups, as broken down by Crowd Size.**\n| Crowd Size | Rapport | Tension |\n| :-----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: |\n| Small (2-10 individuals) | 6 | 6 |\n| Medium (11-25 individuals) | 8 | 8 |\n| Large (26-50 individuals) | 10 | 10 |\n| Impressive (51-100 individuals) | 12 | 12 |\n| Massive (101-300 individuals) | 15 | 15 |\n| Staggering (301-999 individuals) | 25 | 25 |\n| Monumental (1000+ individuals) | 40 | 40 |\n\n\n## Goal Table\n**These detail the CR and Social Clock modifiers for a number of situations, to serve as a benchmark and guideline for GMs to set CRs.**\n| Convincing a(n)... | Challenge Rating | Rapport | Tension |\n| :----------- | :----------- | :-----------: | :-----------: |\n| Enemy to betray their allies | Almost Impossible (-40) | +9 Span | -6 Span | \n| Wild pokemon to be captured | Almost Impossible (-40) | +2 Span | +0 Span | \n| Enemy to surrender/flee a fight | Almost Impossible (-40) | +3 Span | -3 Span | \n| Individual to give you a valuable item for free | Almost Impossible (-40) | +2 Span | -3 Span | \n| Individual to trade at a staggering discount (81-99% discount on their items’ true value) | Almost Impossible (-40) | +1 Span | -2 Span |\n| Individual to trade at a ludicrous discount (51%-80% discount on their items’ true value) | Intense (-30) | +1 Span | -2 Span | \n| Individual to offer a steep discount (21%-50% discount on their items’ true value) | Hard (-20) | +0 Span | +0 Span |\n| Individual to offer a slight discount (1%-20% discount on their items’ true value) | Challenging (+0) | +0 Span | +0 Span |\n| Individual to stop doing an important task for some time (like guarding a door, checking for contraband, or checking food for poison) | Intense (-30) | +2 Span | -2 Span |\n| Manic individual to calm down | Intense (-30) | +2 Span | -4 Span |\n| Angry mob to calm down | Almost Impossible (-40) | +4 Span | -5 Span |\n| Crowd to rally behind a cause that directly clashes with their morals | Intense (-30) | +3 Span | -3 Span |\n| Crowd to rally behind a cause that somewhat clashes with their morals | Hard (-20) | +1 Span | -2 Span |\n| Crowd to rally behind a cause that does not oppose their morals | Hard (-20) | +0 Span | +0 Span |\n| Group of police officers that you’re not the criminal they’re looking for | Intense (-30) | +3 Span | -1 Span |\n| Group of Pokemon that you mean no harm | Average (+10) | +0 Span | +1 Span |\n| Ally to perform a small favor (pulling a lever, handing over an item of insignificant value, or helping you perform a safe, legal action) | Simple (+20) | -1 Span | +3 Span |",

        "content": "<p>Weather, like your heavy rain and strong sunlight, are integral parts of Pokemon's identity. With the magic of automation, we can finally include these effects in a TTRPG context, and expand on them!</p>\n<p>Weathers come in two varieties: <strong>[Weather]</strong> and <strong>[Intense Weather]</strong>. Standard [Weather] is made up of your standard inclement weather from the games: sun, rain, snow, etc., while [Intense Weathers] (called \"Primal Weathers\" by some) epitomize the Weathers set by the Super-ancient/Weather Trio in their Primal and Mega Formes. Our list is expanded to ten specific Weathers, all with Intense versions.</p>\n<p>Weathers are Field effects, generally boxed into single rooms/airspaces (via Foundry’s region effects), though the Intense Weathers may be more expansive (perhaps conferring the standard weather to adjacent rooms).</p>\n<p>There may only be 2 Weathers or 1 Intense Weather active in a Region at any given time. If a third Weather or another Intense Weather would be activated, the oldest respective effect is immediately ended.</p>\n<h2>Clear</h2>\n<p><strong>Weather Type</strong>: Normal</p>\n<p>Clear Weather demarks the natural weather of an environment, like standard sunshine or a mere drizzle. Provides no additional effects.</p>\n<h2>Sunny</h2>\n<p><strong>Weather Type</strong>: Fire</p>\n<p><strong>Sunny</strong> is the presence of harsh, overbearing sunlight, making fires burn hotter, and photosynthesis seemingly improving. Generally, Fire- and Grass- Types benefit from Sunny Weather.</p>\n<h4>Effects:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fire-Type Attacks deal 30% more damage, and Water-Type Attacks deal 30% less damage.</li>\n<li>Grass-Type creatures gain 30% to their Movement Allowances, and their SPD is increased 15%.</li>\n<li>Fire-Type Attacks are resisted one step less by Water-Types.</li>\n<li>Creatures cannot be Frozen, and Frozen creatures are cured of Frozen.</li>\n<li>Fire-Type Moves and Physical-Category Steel-Type attacks have a 10% chance to inflict Burn 5. Attacks that would already cause Burn instead increase their chance to Burn by 10%.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Intense Heat</h2>\n<p><strong>Weather Type</strong>: Fire</p>\n<p><strong>Intense Heat</strong> is the supercharged sunshine that causes droughts - withering plants and dehydrating all that are present. Fire-Types benefit the most, although the effects on all other Types are more pronounced.</p>\n<h4>Effects:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>For the purposes of Abilities, Attacks, Perks, and Traits, this Weather is considered to also be “Sunny”.</li>\n<li>Fire-Type Attacks deal 60% more damage, and all Water-Type Attacks fail to activate.</li>\n<li>Grass-Type creatures gain 60% to their Movement Allowances, and their SPD is increased 30%, but lose a Tick of HP at the end of their Activations.</li>\n<li>Fire-Type Attacks are one step more effective on all Types, and are super effective against Water-Types.</li>\n<li>Creatures cannot be Frozen, and Frozen creatures are cured of Frozen.</li>\n<li>Non-Fire-, Grass-, Rock-, and Ground Types have -1 default DEF.</li>\n<li>Fire-Type Moves and Physical-Category Steel-Type attacks have a 25% chance to inflict Burn 5. Attacks that would already cause Burn instead increase their chance to Burn by 25%.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Rainy</h2>\n<p><strong>Weather Type</strong>: Water</p>\n<p><strong>Rainy</strong> is more typical of an intense tropical storm, as in the raindrops being liable to cause physical pain because they're so big and fast. Water-Types unanimously excel in rain, but their Electric archenemy finds it easier to deal with them.</p>\n<h4>Effects:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Water-Type Attacks deal 30% more damage, and Fire-Type Attacks deal 30% less damage.</li>\n<li>Non-[Contact] Electric-Type Attacks have +30% Range (minimum +1).</li>\n<li>All creatures resist [Explode] Attacks one step further.</li>\n<li>All Water-Type creatures gain a bonus to their Overland Allowance equal to 60% of their Swim Allowance.</li>\n<li>Physical-Category Attacks suffer an additional -1 ACC from RIP.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Intense Downpour</h2>\n<p><strong>Weather Type</strong>: Water</p>\n<p><strong>Intense Downpour</strong> is a storm of Biblical proportions. An absurdly heavy downpour that smothers flames and causes Trainers to regret not bringing their water wings. Extremely beneficial to Water-Types and strong swimmers.</p>\n<h4>Effects:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>For the purposes of Abilities, Attacks, Perks, and Traits, this Weather is considered to also be “Rainy”.</li>\n<li>Water-Type Attacks deal 60% more damage, and Fire-Type Attacks fail to activate when declared.</li>\n<li>Non-[Contact] Electric-Type Attacks have +60% Range (minimum +2).</li>\n<li>All [Explode] Attacks fail to activate when declared.</li>\n<li>All Water-Type have their Swim Allowance increased by 60%.</li>\n<li>All creatures may utilize Swim Movement in place of their Overland Movement. All creatures without [Hover] are Grounded, and all creatures have their non-Swim Allowances reduced by 50% (minimum 3).</li>\n<li>Physical-Category Attacks suffer an additional -1 ACC from RIP, and have their Range decreased by 30% (minimum Range is the creature’s Reach).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Snowy</h2>\n<p><strong>Weather Type</strong>: Ice</p>\n<p><strong>Snowy</strong> consists of a fairly heavy flurry of snow, with the chill to accompany it. Ice-Types are quite content in the snow, and the cold has some knock-on effects that you may not expect!</p>\n<h4>Effects:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Ice-Type Attacks deal 30% more damage when they are Critical Hits.</li>\n<li>Ice-Type creatures have their DEF stat increased by 50%.</li>\n<li>At the end of the Round, non-Ice Type creatures lose a Tick of HP.</li>\n<li>All Hazards gain the Ice-Type.</li>\n<li>Ice-Type Moves and Physical-Category Steel-Type attacks have a 10% chance to inflict Frostbite 5. Attacks that would already cause Frostbite instead increase their chance to inflict Frostbite by 10%.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Intense Snowfall</h2>\n<p><strong>Weather Type</strong>: Ice</p>\n<p><strong>Intense Snowfall</strong> might as well be the herald of a new Ice Age! Bone-shattering cold and shredding ice is the name of the game, and if you lack the Ice-Type, you're probably not going to be full of myrth and holiday cheer.</p>\n<h4>Effects:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>For the purposes of Abilities, Attacks, Perks, and Traits, this Weather is considered to also be “Snowy”.</li>\n<li>Ice-Type Attacks deal 60% more damage when they are Critical Hits.</li>\n<li>Ice-Type creatures have their DEF stat increased by 75%, and SPDEF stat increased by 25%</li>\n<li>Ice-Type creatures are Hardened.</li>\n<li>At the end of their Activation, non-Ice Type creatures lose a Tick of HP.</li>\n<li>All non-Ice Type creatures have -1 default SPDEF.</li>\n<li>All Hazards and Physical- and Special-Category Water-Type Attacks gain the Ice-Type.</li>\n<li>Ice-Type Moves and Physical-Category Steel-Type attacks have a 20% chance to inflict Frostbite 5. Attacks that would already cause Frostbite instead increase their chance to inflict Frostbite by 20%.</li>\n<li>Ice-Type Moves have a 10% chance to inflict Frozen 3. Attacks that would already cause Frozen instead increase their chance to inflict Frozen by 10%.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Dusty</h2>\n<p><strong>Weather Type</strong>: Rock</p>\n<p><strong>Dusty</strong> covers both sandstorms and dust bowls - generally windstorms with large amounts of particulate rock or minerals that aren't particularly fun to go through. Creatures who embody the Rock or Ground are at home here, usually, and is basically Snowy without the ice.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rock- and Ground-Type creatures have their SPDEF stat increased by 50%.</li>\n<li>At the end of the Round, non-Rock-, Ground- and Steel-Type creatures lose a Tick of HP.</li>\n<li>Non-Ground-, Rock- and Steel-Type creatures are Slowed.</li>\n<li>All Hazards gain the Rock-Type.</li>\n<li>Special-Category Attacks suffer an additional -1 ACC from RIP.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Intense Dust Storm</h2>\n<p><strong>Weather Type</strong>: Rock</p>\n<p><strong>Intense Dust Storm</strong>, fittingly, can be best described by a passage from <em>Children of Dune</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>In the olden times, the birds were named for their songs. Each wind had its name. A six-klick wind was called a Pastaza, a twenty-klick wind was Cueshma, and a hundred-klick wind was Heinali - Heinali, the man-pusher. Then there was the wind of the demon in the open desert: Hulasikali Wala, the wind that eats flesh.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What fits the dust storm to end all dust storms, than comparing it to a demon? Truely, those not made of sand or stone are liable to suffer in its wake.</p>\n<h4>Effects:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>For the purposes of Abilities, Attacks, Perks, and Traits, this Weather is considered to also be “Dusty”.</li>\n<li>Rock- and Ground-Type creatures have their SPDEF stat increased by 75%, and their DEF stat increased by 25%.</li>\n<li>At the end of their Activations, non-Ground-, Rock- and Steel-Type creatures lose a Tick of HP.</li>\n<li>At the end of each round, Rock- and Ground-Type creatures heal two Ticks of HP.</li>\n<li>Non-Ground-, Rock- and Steel-Type creatures are Slowed and Grounded.</li>\n<li>Special-Category Attacks suffer an additional -1 ACC from RIP, and have their Range decreased by 30% (minimum Range is the creature’s Reach).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Foggy</h2>\n<p><strong>Weather Type</strong>: Normal</p>\n<p><strong>Foggy</strong> is pretty simple - a low-rolling, low-visbility wave of fog, obscuring vision as if you were inside a cloud. Notably, if you don't use normal ways to see and perceive, you might be at an advantage.</p>\n<h4>Effects:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Creatures without special forms of sight have -1 ACC on actions or attacks against creatures outside their Reach.</li>\n<li>Electric-Type Attacks deal 30% less damage.</li>\n<li>Bug-Type creatures possess Low Cover against Ranged attacks and have their SPD increased by 25%.</li>\n<li>Psychic-Type creatures have their SPATK and SPDEF stats increased by 20%.</li>\n<li>Sleight of Hand and Stealth rolls gain +1 DoS, and Navigate and Spot rolls lose -1 DoS.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Intense Fog</h2>\n<p><strong>Weather Type</strong>: Normal</p>\n<p>Intense Fog is something unparalleled, a truly oppressive and phobia-inducing soup that may cause one to struggle to even see their own hand in front of their face. This fog is so thick, you may even struggle to see silouettes in its walls. Predators and the clairvoyant are at their peak in these conditions.</p>\n<h4>Effects:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>For the purposes of Abilities, Attacks, Perks, and Traits, this Weather is considered to also be “Foggy”.</li>\n<li>Creatures without special forms of sight have -1 ACC on actions or attacks against creatures outside their Reach.</li>\n<li>Electric-Type Attacks deal 60% less damage.</li>\n<li>Creatures without special forms of sight are always considered to be in Rough Terrain and have their Attacks and Abilities lose [Friendly].</li>\n<li>Bug-Type creatures possess High Cover against Ranged attacks and have their SPD increased by 50%.</li>\n<li>Psychic-Type creatures have their SPATK and SPDEF stats increased by 40%.</li>\n<li>Sleight of Hand and Stealth rolls gain +2 DoS, and Navigate and Spot rolls lose -2 DoS.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Windy</h2>\n<p><strong>Weather Type</strong>: Flying</p>\n<p><strong>Windy</strong> is the pretty obvious presence of high speed winds. If you lose your footing, you're likely to be picked up and thrown about! But, creatures adapted to the air are in their element with these heavy winds.</p>\n<h4>Effects:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Flying-Type creatures and creatures with Flight Allowances have their SPD increased 30%.</li>\n<li>[Wind] attacks deal 40% more damage.</li>\n<li>All creatures with a natural Flight Movement Score have that Score increase by 30%.</li>\n<li>All [Dash] and [Reckless] attacks without [Push X] gain [Push 1]. When Pushed, all creatures are Pushed an additional X meters (minimum of 0), where X is equal to 6 minus their Weight Class.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Intense Winds</h2>\n<p><strong>Weather Type</strong>: Flying</p>\n<p><strong>Intense Winds</strong> are, for many, completely unmanageable. Without decent aerodyanmics, you'd basically be helpless. But for the lords of the air, they might as well be unassailable in their \"gale-force fortress\".</p>\n<h4>Effects:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>For the purposes of Abilities, Attacks, Perks, and Traits, this Weather is considered to also be “Windy”.</li>\n<li>Flying-Type creatures and creatures with Flight Allowances have their SPD increased 60%.</li>\n<li>[Wind] attacks deal 80% more damage.</li>\n<li>All creatures with a natural Movement Score have that Score increase by 60%.</li>\n<li>Flying-Type creatures gain a Flight Score equal to 80% of their Overland (minimum 3).</li>\n<li>Flying-Type creatures have their DEF stat increased by 25% and SPDEF stat increased by 25%.</li>\n<li>The Flying Type’s weaknesses are instead neutral.</li>\n<li>All [Dash] and [Reckless] attacks without [Push X] gain [Push 1]. When Pushed, all creatures are Pushed an additional X meters (minimum of 0), where X is equal to 12 minus their Weight Class.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Gloomy</h2>\n<p><strong>Weather Type</strong>: Dark</p>\n<p><strong>Gloomy</strong> is that electricity in the air at dusk and twilight, the charge of life changing gears from day to night. And when the supernatural comes into play, the doors to witchcraft, demons, and the otherworld creak open to the plight of those that are unprepared.</p>\n<h4>Effects:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Ghost, Dark, and Fairy-Type Attacks deal 20% more damage.</li>\n<li>Ghost, Dark, and Fairy-Type creatures’s Attacks and Abilities have their effect chances increase by 5%.</li>\n<li>Non-Ghost, Dark, and Fairy-Type creatures are Hindered.</li>\n<li>When a Ghost, Dark, or Fairy-Type creature inflicts a Status Affliction on a target, that target gains Fear 2.</li>\n<li>All [Hazard] attacks and abilities used by a Ghost, Dark, or Fairy-Type creature have a 30% longer range (minimum 1), and the number of Hazards they create is increased by 50% (minimum 1).</li>\n<li>When a creature is affected by a Hazard created by Ghost, Dark, and Fairy-Type creature, that creature loses a Tick of HP, in addition to the Hazard’s other effects.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Intense Umbra</h2>\n<p><strong>Weather Type</strong>: Dark</p>\n<p><strong>Intense Umbra</strong> is a state beyond a mere Witching Hour. Indeed, the veil is thrown down and the supernatural runs amok. Woe be to those who befall the curses and misfortunes that await in the dark.</p>\n<h4>Effects:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>For the purposes of Abilities, Attacks, Perks, and Traits, this Weather is considered to also be “Gloomy”.</li>\n<li>Ghost, Dark, and Fairy-Type Attacks deal 40% more damage.</li>\n<li>Ghost, Dark, and Fairy-Type creatures’s Attacks and Abilities have their effect chances increase by 10%.</li>\n<li>Non-Ghost, Dark, and Fairy-Type creatures are Hindered.</li>\n<li>When a Ghost, Dark, or Fairy-Type creature inflicts a Status Affliction on a target, that target gains Fear 4, and has:<ul>\n<li>a 5% chance of gaining Cursed 3 (if source creature is Ghost-Type),</li>\n<li>a 25% chance of gaining Confused 3 (if source creature is Dark-Type), and</li>\n<li>a 15% chance of gaining Charmed 3 (if source creature is Fairy-Type)</li></ul></li>\n<li>All [Hazard] attacks and abilities used by a Ghost, Dark, or Fairy-Type creature have a 60% longer range (minimum 2), and the number of Hazards they create is increased by 80% (minimum 2). </li>\n<li>When a creature is affected by a Hazard created by Ghost, Dark, and Fairy-Type creature, that creature loses two Ticks of HP and is Suppressed 3, in addition to the Hazard’s other effects.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Smoggy</h2>\n<p><strong>Weather Type</strong>: Poison</p>\n<p>Smoggy is the presence of an smothering cloud of pollutants and toxins, which impede the functions and actions of most creatures. The artificial and those with immunities to the toxins are far more likely to take advantage of this enfeebling haze.</p>\n<h4>Effects:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Poison-Type Attacks deal 20% more damage, and have an additional 10% chance to inflict Poison or Blight.</li>\n<li>All non-Poison and Steel-Type creatures take 25% more damage from Physical-Category Attacks.</li>\n<li>At the end of the Round, non-Poison- and Steel-Type creatures lose a Tick of HP.</li>\n<li>While a creature is Poisoned or Blighted, they possess -1 default ACC.</li>\n<li>When a creature takes a Critical Hit from a [Sharp] attack, gain Poisoned 5.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Intense Acid Rain</h2>\n<p><strong>Weather Type</strong>: Poison</p>\n<p><strong>Intense Acid Rain</strong> consists of the showers that result from the polluted clouds growing too heavy and full.

Creatures that are already ill-tempered or laser-focused become more ferocious in these conditions.</p>\n<h4>Effects:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Shadow-Type creatures and creatures that have [Closed Heart] have their ATK and SPATK stats increased by 25%.</li>\n<li>At the end of the Round, non-Shadow-Type creatures and creatures that lack [Closed Heart] lose a Tick of HP.</li>\n<li>All creatures take 10% more damage from all sources, and have -1 default EVA.</li>\n<li>When hit by a Shadow-Type Attack, non-Shadow-Type creatures and creatures that lack [Closed Heart] have a 30% chance to be Flinched 2, and a 20% chance to gain Taunted 3.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Intense Enshrouding</h2>\n<p><strong>Weather Type</strong>: Shadow</p>\n<p><strong>Intense Enshrouding</strong> goes far beyond the mere manipulations of emotion, being a physical and psychic miasma that permeates everything inside and within. The stressors are so severe, reason becomes a distant hope in the wake of sheer brutality and desperation to survive.</p>\n<h4>Effects:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>For the purposes of Abilities, Attacks, Perks, and Traits, this Weather is considered to also be “Shady”.</li>\n<li>Shadow-Type creatures and creatures that have [Closed Heart] have their ATK and SPATK stats increased by 50%.</li>\n<li>While they are in Hyper Mode, Shadow-Type creatures and creatures that have [Closed Heart] are Suppressed and Boosted, and lose a Tick of HP at the end of each of their Activations.</li>\n<li>At the end of their Activation, non-Shadow-Type creatures and creatures that lack [Closed Heart] lose a Tick of HP.</li>\n<li>All creatures take 25% more damage from all sources, and have -2 default EVA.</li>\n<li>When hit by a Shadow-Type Attack, non-Shadow-Type creatures and creatures that lack [Closed Heart] have a 30% chance to be Flinched 4, a 20% chance to gain Taunted 3, and a 20% chance to gain Enraged 5.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Glowy</h2>\n<p><strong>Weather Type</strong>: Nuclear</p>\n<p><strong>Glowy</strong> is an odd sensation. The air feels \"charged\", full of energy and invigoration, but also it spurs tension and anxiety. One could say it's the most reasonable \"danger\" response, as this energy is uncomfortable to most creatures, and downright harmful with longer exposure.</p>\n<h4>Effects:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>At the end of their Activation, non-Steel- and Nuclear-Type creatures lose a Tick of HP.</li>\n<li>Nuclear-Type creatures gain 30% to their Movement Allowances and their SPD is increased 30%.</li>\n<li>At the end of each round, non-Nuclear-Type creatures have one of their Abilities randomly Nullified 3.</li>\n<li>Non-Steel- and Nuclear-Type creatures are Stunted.</li>\n<li>Steel-Type Attacks have a 15% chance to inflict Unlucky 5.

Particularly, Nuclear-Type creatures are supercharged here, making them almost terrifingly effective combatants against basically everything else.</p>\n<h4>Effects:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>At the end of their Activation, non-Steel- and Nuclear-Type creatures lose two Ticks of HP.</li>\n<li>Nuclear-Type creatures gain 50% to their Movement Allowances each Round, their SPD is increased 50%.</li>\n<li>At the end of each round, non-Nuclear-Type creatures have one of their Abilities randomly Nullified 7.</li>\n<li>At the end of each round, Nuclear-Type creatures gain a Tick of HP and a Tick of PP.</li>\n<li>Non-Steel- and Nuclear-Type creatures are Blinded and Stunted.</li>\n<li>Steel-Type Attacks have a 25% chance to inflict Unlucky 5.

However, unlike Weathers, Terrains only affect creatures physically touching a surface the Terrain affects (which the Grounded Affliction forces). Being suspended in the air or a liquid makes you immune to their effects, while all creatures underground are still affected. Some abilities allow creatures to be affected by certain Terrains even while they’re not touching the surface.</p>\n<p>There may only be one Terrain active in a Region at any given time. If another Terrain effect is activated, the existing Terrain effect is ended and replaced with the new one.</p>\n<h2>Grassy Terrain</h2>\n<p><strong>Terrain Type</strong>: Grass</p>\n<p>Increases the Power of Grass-Type attacks by 30%, reduces the damage of [Earthbound] attacks by 50%, and restores 3 Ticks of HP to creatures at the end of each Round.</p>\n<h2>Electric Terrain</h2>\n<p><strong>Terrain Type</strong>: Electric</p>\n<p>Increases the Power of Electric-Type attacks by 30%, and cures creatures of Drowsy and Nightmares.</p>\n<h2>Psychic Terrain</h2>\n<p><strong>Terrain Type</strong>: Psychic</p>\n<p>Increases the Power of Psychic-Type attacks by 30%, and all Actions with [Priority X] and/or [Interrupt X] lose that Trait(s).</p>\n<h2>Misty Terrain</h2>\n<p><strong>Terrain Type</strong>: Fairy</p>\n<p>Halves the damage taken from Dragon-Type attacks and effects. Whenever a Minor Status Affliction would be afflicted on a creature from a source other than itself or a Major Status Affliction, they have a 50% chance to not be afflicted with that Minor Status Affliction.</p>\n<h2>Sticky Terrain</h2>\n<p><strong>Terrain Type</strong>: Bug</p>\n<p>Increases the Power of Bug-Type attacks by 30%, and creatures without [Wallclimber] or the Bug-Type are Stuck and Hindered.</p>\n<h2>Flooded Terrain</h2>\n<p><strong>Terrain Type</strong>: Water</p>\n<p>Halves the damage taken from Fire-Type attacks and effects. Creatures must use their Swim movement in place of Overland.</p>\n<h2>Mucky Terrain</h2>\n<p><strong>Terrain Type</strong>: Ground</p>\n<p>Halves the damage taken from Electric-Type attacks and effects. Creatures without [Mud-Runner] affected by this Terrain are Slowed.</p>\n<h2>Sanctified Terrain</h2>\n<p><strong>Terrain Type</strong>: Normal</p>\n<p>Halves the damage taken from Shadow-Type attacks and effects. [Stage Change] and [Pseudo Affliction] effects originating from or targeting affected creatures have their durations increased by 40% (minimum 1).</p>\n<h2>Scorched Terrain</h2>\n<p><strong>Terrain Type</strong>: Fire</p>\n<p>All Hazards and Rooms are removed, and new Hazards cannot be placed. Halves the damage taken from Ice Type attacks.</p>\n<h2>TENTATIVE: Digital Terrain</h2>\n<p>All healing is 50% less effective. </p>\n<h2>TENTATIVE: Acoustic Terrain</h2>\n<p>All [Sonic] attacks have their Power and Range increased by 30%, and have their [Blast X] increase by +1 and [X-Strike] increase by +2.</p>\n<h1>[Room]</h1>\n<p>Rooms are Field effects, boxed into a single space using Foundry’s region feature. Rooms are more universal than Weathers and Terrains; any number of Rooms may be active simultaneously, and few effects actually negate them outright.</p>\n<h2>Ion Deluge</h2>\n<p>All Normal-Type attacks become Electric-Type.</p>\n<h2>Magic Field</h2>\n<p>All [Wielded] and [Held] Items cannot be utilized, and the user cannot activate non-Passive effects of equipment or gear they possess. Actions or attacks that manipulate Held Items of others may still be used (such as Trick and Pluck).</p>\n<h2>Trick Room</h2>\n<p>The Speed of all creatures is reversed (tentative, implementation an issue).</p>\n<h2>Wonder Room</h2>\n<p>The DEF and SPDEF stats of each Pokemon are swapped.</p>\n<h2>Null Room</h2>\n<p>All creatures have one of their abilities Nullified, determined randomly (if an ability cannot be Nullified, another ability is selected).</p>\n<h2>Singularity</h2>\n<p>All Type-based weaknesses, resistances, and immunities are negated. Effectiveness may still be changed separately by attacks and abilities.</p>\n<h2>Rainbow</h2>\n<p>All creatures' attacks and abilities that have a chance of causing an effect have that chance doubled.</p>\n<h2>TENTATIVE: Refreshing Field</h2>\n<p>All creatures affected by Charmed, Enraged, Taunted, Fear, Disabled, Nullified, Suppressed, and the effect of Torment are cured of those effects.</p>\n<h2>TENTATIVE: Invigoration Room</h2>\n<p>All [Set-Up] Attacks resolve their Set-Up and Resolution phases on the same activation.</p>\n<h2>TENTATIVE: Zero Room</h2>\n<p>All creatures’ [Stage Change] effects are overridden to be “0” while Zero Room is active.</p>\n<h2>TENTATIVE: Reverb Room</h2>\n<p>[Sonic] attacks have their effect range doubled, have their effect durations increase by +2, have their [Stage Change] effects double in intensity, deal 25% more damage, and have their Accuracy increase by +20.</p>\n<h1>Nature Power Tables</h1>\n<h2>Environment Based</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th id=\"environment\">Environment</th>\n<th id=\"attack\">Attack</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Building, urban interior</td>\n<td>Swift</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Roadway, urban exterior</td>\n<td>Tri-Attack</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sandy, warm/lukewarm arid</td>\n<td>Earth Power</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cave</td>\n<td>Power Gem</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mountainous</td>\n<td>Rock Slide</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Grass, tall grass</td>\n<td>Stun Spore</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Long grass, brush</td>\n<td>Seed Bomb</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Forest</td>\n<td>Wood Hammer</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tropical forest</td>\n<td>Strength Sap</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Freshwater (creek, pond)</td>\n<td>Aqua Ring</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Freshwater (river, lake)</td>\n<td>Water Pulse</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Saltwater</td>\n<td>Brine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Underwater</td>\n<td>Hydro Pump</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Marshland, swampwater</td>\n<td>Mud Bomb</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Snowy, cold arid</td>\n<td>Frost Breath</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tundra, taiga</td>\n<td>Icy Wind</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Volcanic</td>\n<td>Lava Plume</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>High in the air</td>\n<td>Air Slash</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Outer Space</td>\n<td>Meteor Mash</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ultra Space</td>\n<td>Psyshock</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Terrain Based</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th id=\"[terrain]\">[Terrain]</th>\n<th id=\"attack\">Attack</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Grassy</td>\n<td>Energy Ball</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Electric</td>\n<td>Discharge</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Psychic</td>\n<td>Psychic Noise</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Misty</td>\n<td>Dazzling Gleam</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sticky</td>\n<td>Web Ball</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Flooded</td>\n<td>Liquidation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mucky</td>\n<td>Muddy Water</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sanctified</td>\n<td>Heal Bell</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Scorched</td>\n<td>Wildfire</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h1>Pledges</h1>\n<p>In addition to the Fire-Water-Grass Elemental core, a Rock-Ice-Ground Physical Pledge triangle and a Fighting-Dark-Psychic Mental Pledge triangle are slated to be added, with the following tentative effects.</p>\n<p><em>Rock-Ice Pledge</em>: For 3 Rounds, Normal-, Fire-, Poison- and Flying-Type Physical- and Special-Category attacks are one step less effective, and all creatures deal 20% more damage with Super Effective Attacks.</p>\n<p><em>Rock-Ground Pledge</em>: For 3 Rounds, all creatures gain the Rough Skin Ability as an Extra Ability, and creatures that already have the Rough Skin Ability as an Active Ability have its effect value double when activated.</p>\n<p><em>Ice-Ground Pledge</em>: The current Weather is set to Snowy for 3 Rounds.

        "markdown": "Weather, like your heavy rain and strong sunlight, are integral parts of Pokemon's identity. With the magic of automation, we can finally include these effects in a TTRPG context, and expand on them!\n\nWeathers come in two varieties: **[Weather]** and **[Intense Weather]**. Standard [Weather] is made up of your standard inclement weather from the games: sun, rain, snow, etc., while [Intense Weathers] (called \"Primal Weathers\" by some) epitomize the Weathers set by the Super-ancient/Weather Trio in their Primal and Mega Formes. Our list is expanded to ten specific Weathers, all with Intense versions.\n\nWeathers are Field effects, generally boxed into single rooms/airspaces (via Foundry’s region effects), though the Intense Weathers may be more expansive (perhaps conferring the standard weather to adjacent rooms).\n\nThere may only be 2 Weathers or 1 Intense Weather active in a Region at any given time. If a third Weather or another Intense Weather would be activated, the oldest respective effect is immediately ended.\n\n## Clear\n**Weather Type**: Normal\n\nClear Weather demarks the natural weather of an environment, like standard sunshine or a mere drizzle. Provides no additional effects.\n\n## Sunny\n**Weather Type**: Fire\n\n**Sunny** is the presence of harsh, overbearing sunlight, making fires burn hotter, and photosynthesis seemingly improving. Generally, Fire- and Grass- Types benefit from Sunny Weather.\n\n#### Effects:\n- Fire-Type Attacks deal 30% more damage, and Water-Type Attacks deal 30% less damage.\n- Grass-Type creatures gain 30% to their Movement Allowances, and their SPD is increased 15%.\n- Fire-Type Attacks are resisted one step less by Water-Types.\n- Creatures cannot be Frozen, and Frozen creatures are cured of Frozen.\n- Fire-Type Moves and Physical-Category Steel-Type attacks have a 10% chance to inflict Burn 5. Attacks that would already cause Burn instead increase their chance to Burn by 10%.\n\n## Intense Heat\n**Weather Type**: Fire\n\n**Intense Heat** is the supercharged sunshine that causes droughts - withering plants and dehydrating all that are present. Fire-Types benefit the most, although the effects on all other Types are more pronounced.\n\n#### Effects:\n- For the purposes of Abilities, Attacks, Perks, and Traits, this Weather is considered to also be “Sunny”.\n- Fire-Type Attacks deal 60% more damage, and all Water-Type Attacks fail to activate.\n- Grass-Type creatures gain 60% to their Movement Allowances, and their SPD is increased 30%, but lose a Tick of HP at the end of their Activations.\n- Fire-Type Attacks are one step more effective on all Types, and are super effective against Water-Types.\n- Creatures cannot be Frozen, and Frozen creatures are cured of Frozen.\n- Non-Fire-, Grass-, Rock-, and Ground Types have -1 default DEF.\n- Fire-Type Moves and Physical-Category Steel-Type attacks have a 25% chance to inflict Burn 5. Attacks that would already cause Burn instead increase their chance to Burn by 25%.\n\n## Rainy\n**Weather Type**: Water\n\n**Rainy** is more typical of an intense tropical storm, as in the raindrops being liable to cause physical pain because they're so big and fast. Water-Types unanimously excel in rain, but their Electric archenemy finds it easier to deal with them.\n\n#### Effects:\n- Water-Type Attacks deal 30% more damage, and Fire-Type Attacks deal 30% less damage.\n- Non-[Contact] Electric-Type Attacks have +30% Range (minimum +1).\n- All creatures resist [Explode] Attacks one step further.\n- All Water-Type creatures gain a bonus to their Overland Allowance equal to 60% of their Swim Allowance.\n- Physical-Category Attacks suffer an additional -1 ACC from RIP.\n\n## Intense Downpour\n**Weather Type**: Water\n\n**Intense Downpour** is a storm of Biblical proportions. An absurdly heavy downpour that smothers flames and causes Trainers to regret not bringing their water wings. Extremely beneficial to Water-Types and strong swimmers.\n\n#### Effects:\n- For the purposes of Abilities, Attacks, Perks, and Traits, this Weather is considered to also be “Rainy”.\n- Water-Type Attacks deal 60% more damage, and Fire-Type Attacks fail to activate when declared.\n- Non-[Contact] Electric-Type Attacks have +60% Range (minimum +2).\n- All [Explode] Attacks fail to activate when declared.\n- All Water-Type have their Swim Allowance increased by 60%.\n- All creatures may utilize Swim Movement in place of their Overland Movement. All creatures without [Hover] are Grounded, and all creatures have their non-Swim Allowances reduced by 50% (minimum 3).\n- Physical-Category Attacks suffer an additional -1 ACC from RIP, and have their Range decreased by 30% (minimum Range is the creature’s Reach).\n\n## Snowy\n**Weather Type**: Ice\n\n**Snowy** consists of a fairly heavy flurry of snow, with the chill to accompany it. Ice-Types are quite content in the snow, and the cold has some knock-on effects that you may not expect!\n\n#### Effects:\n- Ice-Type Attacks deal 30% more damage when they are Critical Hits.\n- Ice-Type creatures have their DEF stat increased by 50%.\n- At the end of the Round, non-Ice Type creatures lose a Tick of HP.\n- All Hazards gain the Ice-Type.\n- Ice-Type Moves and Physical-Category Steel-Type attacks have a 10% chance to inflict Frostbite 5. Attacks that would already cause Frostbite instead increase their chance to inflict Frostbite by 10%.\n\n\n## Intense Snowfall\n**Weather Type**: Ice\n\n**Intense Snowfall** might as well be the herald of a new Ice Age! Bone-shattering cold and shredding ice is the name of the game, and if you lack the Ice-Type, you're probably not going to be full of myrth and holiday cheer.\n\n#### Effects:\n- For the purposes of Abilities, Attacks, Perks, and Traits, this Weather is considered to also be “Snowy”.\n- Ice-Type Attacks deal 60% more damage when they are Critical Hits.\n- Ice-Type creatures have their DEF stat increased by 75%, and SPDEF stat increased by 25%\n- Ice-Type creatures are Hardened.\n- At the end of their Activation, non-Ice Type creatures lose a Tick of HP.\n- All non-Ice Type creatures have -1 default SPDEF.\n- All Hazards and Physical- and Special-Category Water-Type Attacks gain the Ice-Type.\n- Ice-Type Moves and Physical-Category Steel-Type attacks have a 20% chance to inflict Frostbite 5. Attacks that would already cause Frostbite instead increase their chance to inflict Frostbite by 20%.\n- Ice-Type Moves have a 10% chance to inflict Frozen 3. Attacks that would already cause Frozen instead increase their chance to inflict Frozen by 10%.\n\n## Dusty\n**Weather Type**: Rock\n\n**Dusty** covers both sandstorms and dust bowls - generally windstorms with large amounts of particulate rock or minerals that aren't particularly fun to go through. Creatures who embody the Rock or Ground are at home here, usually, and is basically Snowy without the ice.\n\n- Rock- and Ground-Type creatures have their SPDEF stat increased by 50%.\n- At the end of the Round, non-Rock-, Ground- and Steel-Type creatures lose a Tick of HP.\n- Non-Ground-, Rock- and Steel-Type creatures are Slowed.\n- All Hazards gain the Rock-Type.\n- Special-Category Attacks suffer an additional -1 ACC from RIP.\n\n## Intense Dust Storm\n**Weather Type**: Rock\n\n**Intense Dust Storm**, fittingly, can be best described by a passage from *Children of Dune*:\n\n> *In the olden times, the birds were named for their songs. Each wind had its name. A six-klick wind was called a Pastaza, a twenty-klick wind was Cueshma, and a hundred-klick wind was Heinali - Heinali, the man-pusher. Then there was the wind of the demon in the open desert: Hulasikali Wala, the wind that eats flesh.*\n\nWhat fits the dust storm to end all dust storms, than comparing it to a demon? Truely, those not made of sand or stone are liable to suffer in its wake.\n\n#### Effects:\n- For the purposes of Abilities, Attacks, Perks, and Traits, this Weather is considered to also be “Dusty”.\n- Rock- and Ground-Type creatures have their SPDEF stat increased by 75%, and their DEF stat increased by 25%.\n- At the end of their Activations, non-Ground-, Rock- and Steel-Type creatures lose a Tick of HP.\n- At the end of each round, Rock- and Ground-Type creatures heal two Ticks of HP.\n- Non-Ground-, Rock- and Steel-Type creatures are Slowed and Grounded.\n- Special-Category Attacks suffer an additional -1 ACC from RIP, and have their Range decreased by 30% (minimum Range is the creature’s Reach).\n\n## Foggy\n**Weather Type**: Normal\n\n**Foggy** is pretty simple - a low-rolling, low-visbility wave of fog, obscuring vision as if you were inside a cloud. Notably, if you don't use normal ways to see and perceive, you might be at an advantage.\n\n#### Effects:\n- Creatures without special forms of sight have -1 ACC on actions or attacks against creatures outside their Reach.\n- Electric-Type Attacks deal 30% less damage.\n- Bug-Type creatures possess Low Cover against Ranged attacks and have their SPD increased by 25%.\n- Psychic-Type creatures have their SPATK and SPDEF stats increased by 20%.\n- Sleight of Hand and Stealth rolls gain +1 DoS, and Navigate and Spot rolls lose -1 DoS.\n\n## Intense Fog\n**Weather Type**: Normal\n\nIntense Fog is something unparalleled, a truly oppressive and phobia-inducing soup that may cause one to struggle to even see their own hand in front of their face. This fog is so thick, you may even struggle to see silouettes in its walls. Predators and the clairvoyant are at their peak in these conditions.\n\n#### Effects:\n- For the purposes of Abilities, Attacks, Perks, and Traits, this Weather is considered to also be “Foggy”.\n- Creatures without special forms of sight have -1 ACC on actions or attacks against creatures outside their Reach.\n- Electric-Type Attacks deal 60% less damage.\n- Creatures without special forms of sight are always considered to be in Rough Terrain and have their Attacks and Abilities lose [Friendly].\n- Bug-Type creatures possess High Cover against Ranged attacks and have their SPD increased by 50%.\n- Psychic-Type creatures have their SPATK and SPDEF stats increased by 40%.\n- Sleight of Hand and Stealth rolls gain +2 DoS, and Navigate and Spot rolls lose -2 DoS.\n\n## Windy\n**Weather Type**: Flying\n\n**Windy** is the pretty obvious presence of high speed winds. If you lose your footing, you're likely to be picked up and thrown about! But, creatures adapted to the air are in their element with these heavy winds.\n\n#### Effects:\n- Flying-Type creatures and creatures with Flight Allowances have their SPD increased 30%.\n- [Wind] attacks deal 40% more damage.\n- All creatures with a natural Flight Movement Score have that Score increase by 30%.\n- All [Dash] and [Reckless] attacks without [Push X] gain [Push 1]. When Pushed, all creatures are Pushed an additional X meters (minimum of 0), where X is equal to 6 minus their Weight Class.\n\n## Intense Winds\n**Weather Type**: Flying\n\n**Intense Winds** are, for many, completely unmanageable. Without decent aerodyanmics, you'd basically be helpless. But for the lords of the air, they might as well be unassailable in their \"gale-force fortress\".\n\n#### Effects:\n- For the purposes of Abilities, Attacks, Perks, and Traits, this Weather is considered to also be “Windy”.\n- Flying-Type creatures and creatures with Flight Allowances have their SPD increased 60%.\n- [Wind] attacks deal 80% more damage.\n- All creatures with a natural Movement Score have that Score increase by 60%.\n- Flying-Type creatures gain a Flight Score equal to 80% of their Overland (minimum 3).\n- Flying-Type creatures have their DEF stat increased by 25% and SPDEF stat increased by 25%.\n- The Flying Type’s weaknesses are instead neutral.\n- All [Dash] and [Reckless] attacks without [Push X] gain [Push 1]. When Pushed, all creatures are Pushed an additional X meters (minimum of 0), where X is equal to 12 minus their Weight Class.\n\n## Gloomy\n**Weather Type**: Dark\n\n**Gloomy** is that electricity in the air at dusk and twilight, the charge of life changing gears from day to night. And when the supernatural comes into play, the doors to witchcraft, demons, and the otherworld creak open to the plight of those that are unprepared.\n\n#### Effects:\n- Ghost, Dark, and Fairy-Type Attacks deal 20% more damage.\n- Ghost, Dark, and Fairy-Type creatures’s Attacks and Abilities have their effect chances increase by 5%.\n- Non-Ghost, Dark, and Fairy-Type creatures are Hindered.\n- When a Ghost, Dark, or Fairy-Type creature inflicts a Status Affliction on a target, that target gains Fear 2.\n- All [Hazard] attacks and abilities used by a Ghost, Dark, or Fairy-Type creature have a 30% longer range (minimum 1), and the number of Hazards they create is increased by 50% (minimum 1).\n- When a creature is affected by a Hazard created by Ghost, Dark, and Fairy-Type creature, that creature loses a Tick of HP, in addition to the Hazard’s other effects.\n\n## Intense Umbra\n**Weather Type**: Dark\n\n**Intense Umbra** is a state beyond a mere Witching Hour. Indeed, the veil is thrown down and the supernatural runs amok. Woe be to those who befall the curses and misfortunes that await in the dark.\n\n#### Effects:\n- For the purposes of Abilities, Attacks, Perks, and Traits, this Weather is considered to also be “Gloomy”.\n- Ghost, Dark, and Fairy-Type Attacks deal 40% more damage.\n- Ghost, Dark, and Fairy-Type creatures’s Attacks and Abilities have their effect chances increase by 10%.\n- Non-Ghost, Dark, and Fairy-Type creatures are Hindered.\n- When a Ghost, Dark, or Fairy-Type creature inflicts a Status Affliction on a target, that target gains Fear 4, and has:\n  - a 5% chance of gaining Cursed 3 (if source creature is Ghost-Type),\n  - a 25% chance of gaining Confused 3 (if source creature is Dark-Type), and\n  - a 15% chance of gaining Charmed 3 (if source creature is Fairy-Type)\n- All [Hazard] attacks and abilities used by a Ghost, Dark, or Fairy-Type creature have a 60% longer range (minimum 2), and the number of Hazards they create is increased by 80% (minimum 2). \n- When a creature is affected by a Hazard created by Ghost, Dark, and Fairy-Type creature, that creature loses two Ticks of HP and is Suppressed 3, in addition to the Hazard’s other effects.\n\n## Smoggy\n**Weather Type**: Poison\n\nSmoggy is the presence of an smothering cloud of pollutants and toxins, which impede the functions and actions of most creatures. The artificial and those with immunities to the toxins are far more likely to take advantage of this enfeebling haze.\n\n#### Effects:\n- Poison-Type Attacks deal 20% more damage, and have an additional 10% chance to inflict Poison or Blight.\n- All non-Poison and Steel-Type creatures take 25% more damage from Physical-Category Attacks.\n- At the end of the Round, non-Poison- and Steel-Type creatures lose a Tick of HP.\n- While a creature is Poisoned or Blighted, they possess -1 default ACC.\n- When a creature takes a Critical Hit from a [Sharp] attack, gain Poisoned 5.\n\n## Intense Acid Rain\n**Weather Type**: Poison\n\n**Intense Acid Rain** consists of the showers that result from the polluted clouds growing too heavy and full. Unless you naturally thrive in poisons, this utterly corrosive rain can melt even the toughest of steel beams.\n\n#### Effects:\n- For the purposes of Abilities, Attacks, Perks, and Traits, this Weather is considered to also be “Smoggy”.\n- Poison-Type Attacks deal 40% more damage, and have an additional 25% chance to inflict Poison or Blight.\n- All non-Poison creatures take 25% more damage from Physical-Category Attacks and deal 25% less damage with those Attacks.\n- At the end of their Activation, non Poison-Type creatures lose a Tick of HP, \n- At the end of the Round, Poison-Type creatures gain two Ticks of HP.\n- While a creature is Poisoned or Blighted, they possess -1 default ACC and are Stunted.\n- When a creature takes a Critical Hit from a [Sharp] attack, they gain Blight 8.\n\n## Shady\nWeather Type: Normal\n\n**Shady** is a bit of an unusual atmospheric phenomenon, consisting of any number of factors, such as pheromonal dispersion and atmospheric natural subliminal manipulation, that together ellict tension, confusion, and aggression in creatures. Creatures that are already ill-tempered or laser-focused become more ferocious in these conditions.\n\n#### Effects:\n- Shadow-Type creatures and creatures that have [Closed Heart] have their ATK and SPATK stats increased by 25%.\n- At the end of the Round, non-Shadow-Type creatures and creatures that lack [Closed Heart] lose a Tick of HP.\n- All creatures take 10% more damage from all sources, and have -1 default EVA.\n- When hit by a Shadow-Type Attack, non-Shadow-Type creatures and creatures that lack [Closed Heart] have a 30% chance to be Flinched 2, and a 20% chance to gain Taunted 3.\n\n## Intense Enshrouding\n**Weather Type**: Shadow\n\n**Intense Enshrouding** goes far beyond the mere manipulations of emotion, being a physical and psychic miasma that permeates everything inside and within. The stressors are so severe, reason becomes a distant hope in the wake of sheer brutality and desperation to survive.\n\n#### Effects:\n- For the purposes of Abilities, Attacks, Perks, and Traits, this Weather is considered to also be “Shady”.\n- Shadow-Type creatures and creatures that have [Closed Heart] have their ATK and SPATK stats increased by 50%.\n- While they are in Hyper Mode, Shadow-Type creatures and creatures that have [Closed Heart] are Suppressed and Boosted, and lose a Tick of HP at the end of each of their Activations.\n- At the end of their Activation, non-Shadow-Type creatures and creatures that lack [Closed Heart] lose a Tick of HP.\n- All creatures take 25% more damage from all sources, and have -2 default EVA.\n- When hit by a Shadow-Type Attack, non-Shadow-Type creatures and creatures that lack [Closed Heart] have a 30% chance to be Flinched 4, a 20% chance to gain Taunted 3, and a 20% chance to gain Enraged 5.\n\n## Glowy\n**Weather Type**: Nuclear\n\n**Glowy** is an odd sensation. The air feels \"charged\", full of energy and invigoration, but also it spurs tension and anxiety. One could say it's the most reasonable \"danger\" response, as this energy is uncomfortable to most creatures, and downright harmful with longer exposure.\n\n#### Effects:\n- At the end of their Activation, non-Steel- and Nuclear-Type creatures lose a Tick of HP.\n- Nuclear-Type creatures gain 30% to their Movement Allowances and their SPD is increased 30%.\n- At the end of each round, non-Nuclear-Type creatures have one of their Abilities randomly Nullified 3.\n- Non-Steel- and Nuclear-Type creatures are Stunted.\n- Steel-Type Attacks have a 15% chance to inflict Unlucky 5. Attacks that would already cause Unlucky 5 instead increase their chance to cause Unlucky by 15%.\n- Nuclear-Type Attacks have a 30% chance to inflict Unlucky 5. Attacks that would already cause Unlucky 5 instead increase their chance to cause Unlucky by 30%.\n\n## Intense Radstorm\n**Weather Type**: Nuclear\n\n**Intense Radstorm** really ratchets up the terrifying, all-consuming nature of the Nuclear Type, making it a truly opporessive and smothering weather to find oneself in. Particularly, Nuclear-Type creatures are supercharged here, making them almost terrifingly effective combatants against basically everything else.\n\n#### Effects:\n- At the end of their Activation, non-Steel- and Nuclear-Type creatures lose two Ticks of HP.\n- Nuclear-Type creatures gain 50% to their Movement Allowances each Round, their SPD is increased 50%.\n- At the end of each round, non-Nuclear-Type creatures have one of their Abilities randomly Nullified 7.\n- At the end of each round, Nuclear-Type creatures gain a Tick of HP and a Tick of PP.\n- Non-Steel- and Nuclear-Type creatures are Blinded and Stunted.\n- Steel-Type Attacks have a 25% chance to inflict Unlucky 5. Attacks that would already cause Unlucky 5 instead increase their chance to cause Unlucky by 25%.\n- Nuclear-Type Attacks have a 50% chance to inflict Unlucky 5. Attacks that would already cause Unlucky 5 instead increase their chance to cause Unlucky by 50%.\n\n# [Terrain]\n**Terrains** are Field effects, boxed into a single space using Foundry’s region feature. However, unlike Weathers, Terrains only affect creatures physically touching a surface the Terrain affects (which the Grounded Affliction forces). Being suspended in the air or a liquid makes you immune to their effects, while all creatures underground are still affected. Some abilities allow creatures to be affected by certain Terrains even while they’re not touching the surface.\n\nThere may only be one Terrain active in a Region at any given time. If another Terrain effect is activated, the existing Terrain effect is ended and replaced with the new one.\n\n## Grassy Terrain\n**Terrain Type**: Grass\n\nIncreases the Power of Grass-Type attacks by 30%, reduces the damage of [Earthbound] attacks by 50%, and restores 3 Ticks of HP to creatures at the end of each Round.\n\n## Electric Terrain\n**Terrain Type**: Electric\n\nIncreases the Power of Electric-Type attacks by 30%, and cures creatures of Drowsy and Nightmares.\n\n## Psychic Terrain\n**Terrain Type**: Psychic\n\nIncreases the Power of Psychic-Type attacks by 30%, and all Actions with [Priority X] and/or [Interrupt X] lose that Trait(s).\n\n## Misty Terrain\n**Terrain Type**: Fairy\n\nHalves the damage taken from Dragon-Type attacks and effects. Whenever a Minor Status Affliction would be afflicted on a creature from a source other than itself or a Major Status Affliction, they have a 50% chance to not be afflicted with that Minor Status Affliction.\n\n## Sticky Terrain\n**Terrain Type**: Bug\n\nIncreases the Power of Bug-Type attacks by 30%, and creatures without [Wallclimber] or the Bug-Type are Stuck and Hindered.\n\n## Flooded Terrain\n**Terrain Type**: Water\n\nHalves the damage taken from Fire-Type attacks and effects. Creatures must use their Swim movement in place of Overland.\n\n## Mucky Terrain\n**Terrain Type**: Ground\n\nHalves the damage taken from Electric-Type attacks and effects. Creatures without [Mud-Runner] affected by this Terrain are Slowed.\n\n## Sanctified Terrain\n**Terrain Type**: Normal\n\nHalves the damage taken from Shadow-Type attacks and effects. [Stage Change] and [Pseudo Affliction] effects originating from or targeting affected creatures have their durations increased by 40% (minimum 1).\n\n## Scorched Terrain\n**Terrain Type**: Fire\n\nAll Hazards and Rooms are removed, and new Hazards cannot be placed. Halves the damage taken from Ice Type attacks.\n\n## TENTATIVE: Digital Terrain\nAll healing is 50% less effective. \n\n## TENTATIVE: Acoustic Terrain\nAll [Sonic] attacks have their Power and Range increased by 30%, and have their [Blast X] increase by +1 and [X-Strike] increase by +2.\n\n# [Room]\nRooms are Field effects, boxed into a single space using Foundry’s region feature. Rooms are more universal than Weathers and Terrains; any number of Rooms may be active simultaneously, and few effects actually negate them outright.\n\n## Ion Deluge\nAll Normal-Type attacks become Electric-Type.\n\n## Magic Field\nAll [Wielded] and [Held] Items cannot be utilized, and the user cannot activate non-Passive effects of equipment or gear they possess. Actions or attacks that manipulate Held Items of others may still be used (such as Trick and Pluck).\n\n## Trick Room\nThe Speed of all creatures is reversed (tentative, implementation an issue).\n\n## Wonder Room\nThe DEF and SPDEF stats of each Pokemon are swapped.\n\n## Null Room\nAll creatures have one of their abilities Nullified, determined randomly (if an ability cannot be Nullified, another ability is selected).\n\n## Singularity\nAll Type-based weaknesses, resistances, and immunities are negated. Effectiveness may still be changed separately by attacks and abilities.\n\n## Rainbow\nAll creatures' attacks and abilities that have a chance of causing an effect have that chance doubled.\n\n## TENTATIVE: Refreshing Field\nAll creatures affected by Charmed, Enraged, Taunted, Fear, Disabled, Nullified, Suppressed, and the effect of Torment are cured of those effects.\n\n## TENTATIVE: Invigoration Room\nAll [Set-Up] Attacks resolve their Set-Up and Resolution phases on the same activation.\n\n## TENTATIVE: Zero Room\nAll creatures’ [Stage Change] effects are overridden to be “0” while Zero Room is active.\n\n## TENTATIVE: Reverb Room\n[Sonic] attacks have their effect range doubled, have their effect durations increase by +2, have their [Stage Change] effects double in intensity, deal 25% more damage, and have their Accuracy increase by +20.\n\n# Nature Power Tables\n## Environment Based\n| Environment | Attack |\n| --- | --- |\n|Building, urban interior | Swift\n|Roadway, urban exterior | Tri-Attack\n|Sandy, warm/lukewarm arid | Earth Power\n|Cave|Power Gem\n|Mountainous|Rock Slide\n|Grass, tall grass|Stun Spore\n|Long grass, brush|Seed Bomb\n|Forest|Wood Hammer\n|Tropical forest|Strength Sap\n|Freshwater (creek, pond)|Aqua Ring\n|Freshwater (river, lake)|Water Pulse\n|Saltwater|Brine\n|Underwater|Hydro Pump\n|Marshland, swampwater|Mud Bomb\n|Snowy, cold arid|Frost Breath\n|Tundra, taiga|Icy Wind\n|Volcanic|Lava Plume\n|High in the air|Air Slash\n|Outer Space|Meteor Mash\n|Ultra Space|Psyshock\n\n\n## Terrain Based\n| [Terrain] | Attack\n| --- | --- |\n| Grassy | Energy Ball\n|Electric|Discharge\n|Psychic|Psychic Noise\n|Misty|Dazzling Gleam\n|Sticky|Web Ball\n|Flooded|Liquidation\n|Mucky|Muddy Water\n|Sanctified|Heal Bell\n|Scorched|Wildfire\n\n\n# Pledges\nIn addition to the Fire-Water-Grass Elemental core, a Rock-Ice-Ground Physical Pledge triangle and a Fighting-Dark-Psychic Mental Pledge triangle are slated to be added, with the following tentative effects.\n\n_Rock-Ice Pledge_: For 3 Rounds, Normal-, Fire-, Poison- and Flying-Type Physical- and Special-Category attacks are one step less effective, and all creatures deal 20% more damage with Super Effective Attacks.\n\n_Rock-Ground Pledge_: For 3 Rounds, all creatures gain the Rough Skin Ability as an Extra Ability, and creatures that already have the Rough Skin Ability as an Active Ability have its effect value double when activated.\n\n_Ice-Ground Pledge_: The current Weather is set to Snowy for 3 Rounds.

        "content": "<p>During Combat, the game changes into a turn based battle. In Combat, an actor will have a certain number of <strong>Activations</strong> each round (usually one to three), determined by their SPD stat and a number of other factors.</p>\n<p>The a creature's Activation is composed of two <strong><em>Simple Actions</em></strong>. Simple Actions are relatively quick to perform without much thought behind them, including the most basic of Attacks. Beyond this, there are other Action Types, many of which are composed of Simple Actions.</p>\n<h2>Complex Actions</h2>\n<p><strong>Complex Actions</strong> require more complicated interactions. Most directly offensive attacks are a Complex Action. Complex Actions consume two Simple Actions, so if you’ve used a Simple Action during an Activation, you cannot use a Complex Action at that time.</p>\n<h2>Priority Actions</h2>\n<p><strong>Priority Actions</strong> are specific actions that allow you to speed up your next Activation. Priority is always defined on an Action with the <strong>[Priority X]</strong> Trait, where X ranges from 1 to 5. After resolving a [Priority X] Action, the user’s next Activation is advanced (AV is decreased) by 10% times the value of the Priority Trait (X).</p>\n<h2>Interrupt Actions</h2>\n<p><strong>Interrupt Actions</strong> are Actions that allow you to interrupt another creature’s Activation, defined by the <strong>[Interrupt X]</strong> Trait. Interrupt Actions are tied to a <strong>Trigger</strong>, which outlines the specific condition when the Interrupt Action can be Activated. Upon using an Interrupt Action, you consume the Action Cost from your next Activation. The amount denoted by the <strong>[Interrupt X]</strong> Trait denotes the hierarchy of Interrupt priority in the case of multiple Interrupt Actions being declared: Highest Interrupt Level to Lowest, and Lowest Base AV to Highest in case of Interrupt Level ties.</p>\n<h2>Free Actions</h2>\n<p><strong>Free Actions</strong> are the easiest actions, requiring very little focus to do. These are normally part of another action or require a specific trigger to perform. Free Actions do not cost Activations to perform, and can be activated as many times so long as you meet the requirements to activate them, though many tend to be during the Action Phase of your Activation. Free Actions resolve after the triggering action or, if used as part of another action, resolves at the point it was initiated. If an Free Action is an Interrupt, it resolves before the triggering action fully resolves.</p>\n<h2>Delay Actions</h2>\n<p><strong>Delay Actions</strong> are telegraphed actions. Like Priority Actions, these have a level denoted by the <strong>[Delay X]</strong> Trait, where X ranges from 1 to 3. When you declare an action with [Delay X], it resolves after X activations have passed or the round ends, whichever comes first. Delay Actions can only be declared on your Activation.</p>\n<p>On your turn, you can declare the “Hold!” Action, a Free Action that allows you to give [Delay X] (setting X to a number of your choice, between 1 and 3) to a Complex Action you possess. When doing so, you can instead specify a <strong>Trigger</strong> for the action to become an <strong>[Interrupt 1]</strong> Action instead. The Trigger you specify can be as general as “anything that enters range will be targeted and attacked” or more specific as needed. Keep in mind that if the Trigger doesn't occur, the action is lost. If the Delay Action is triggered as an Interrupt, you must pay the Action Cost from your next Activation as if it was a regular Interrupt Action.</p>\n<h1>Making Attacks</h1>\n<p>In order to make an attack, the player must first declare that they are intending to do so. Afterward, determine the targeting of the attack appropriately  (whether Area of Effect, etc).</p>\n<p>The system will automatically expend the necessary PP, but you may have to deduct additional PP manually in the event of using Move Traits such as [Pass-X].</p>\n<p>When initiating the attack by clicking on the attack's icon in your HUD, it will bring up any applicable automation. Here you will be able to see any range increment penalties being applied, and any modifiers that may need to be manually activated or de-activated.</p>\n<p>After resolving the attack, the GM can override Hit and Critical Hit status if necessary by clicking on the hit/miss indicator. A small targeting reticule also will be present on the chat card. Targeting can be overriden and the attack re-resolved (such as in the case of an Intercept) against the new target by holding the Alt key and clicking this reticule.</p>\n<h2>Targeting and Range</h2>\n<p>All Actions, not just Attacks, and including Abilities, have both a <strong>Target</strong> and a <strong>Range</strong>. Targeting impacts how a target for an Action is selected, and whether or not a template may be used. These targets are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Self</strong>: Always listed at Range \"Om\", these Actions target the user exclusively. </li>\n<li><strong>Creature</strong>: These Actions generally target another creature.</li>\n<li><strong>Ally</strong>: Rather than all creatures, these Actions may only target an allied creature, excluding the user.</li>\n<li><strong>Enemy</strong>: Rather than all creatures, these Actions may only target an enemy creature.</li>\n<li><strong>Object</strong>: Instead of a creature, these Actions target an Object. Note: this may also mean they may be able to target an otherwise empty space.</li>\n<li><strong>Blast</strong>: These Actions target a space within range, and affect a spherical area centered on that space. The radius of the sphere is dependent on the the [Blast X] trait the Action possesses, being equal to X.5m.</li>\n<li><strong>Cone</strong>: These Actions target a Cone-shaped area, centered on a space the user occupies (user's choice). These Cones are templates that are X.5m long, in a direction the user chooses, with a Cone angle of 75°.</li>\n<li><strong>Line</strong>: These Actions target creatures in a line-shaped template Xm long, affecting creatures in the spaces the line crosses.</li>\n<li><strong>Wide Line</strong>: These Actions target creatures in a rectangle-shaped template, affecting creatures in the spaces the rectangle passes through, length of Xm. The width of the ray is dependent on the creature's Size, at minimum 2m.</li>\n<li><strong>Emanation</strong>: These Actions emanates Xm from the edges of the user’s token, affecting valid targets within this range. Functionally, this is a circle with a radius of X+Ym, where Y = half of the user token’s side length, minimum 0.5, centered on the user's center space.</li>\n<li><strong>Field</strong>: These Actions affect every creature in a scene or combat. This is generally all creatures in a local vicinity or \"encounter\", though the definition is flexible and usually defined by the GM.</li>\n<li><strong>Aura</strong>: Function identically to Emanations, but are always active instead of a one-time effect or Action.</li>\n<li><strong>Allied Aura</strong>: As Aura, but only affecting allied creatures.</li>\n<li><strong>Enemy Aura</strong>: As Aura, but only affecting enemy creatures.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>[Contact]</strong> Actions function a little differently - their Range is influenced by the user's <strong>Reach</strong>, with their Range being <code>ActionRange + UserReach - 1</code>.</p>\n  <p><strong>Note</strong>: Actions, in their effect text, may specify additional conditions to fulfill, or even an additional or expanded range/targeting mechanic past the Action's Targeting field. <em>Make sure you're always reading effect texts carefully!</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Range Increments</h3>\n<p><strong>Range Increments</strong> are the “effective range” of an Action, where it’s most effective. Past the first Range Increment (RI1), you receive compounding Range Increment Penalties (RIP) that affect your effective accuracy for the attack:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>RI1</strong>: normal</li>\n<li><strong>RI2</strong>: -1 ACC</li>\n<li><strong>RI3</strong>: -3 ACC</li>\n<li><strong>RI4</strong>: -6 ACC</li>\n<li><strong>RI5+</strong>: Attack failure</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you would accrue more than -6 ACC when at RI2 or further out, an Attack fails: not dealing damage, not activating secondary effects, not activating on-miss effects.</p>\n<p><em>Area of effect and [Contact] Actions do not interact with Range Increments at all</em> - they miss against targets outside of their listed/modified Range.</p>\n<h2>Effect Triggers</h2>\n<p>A number of Actions or Effects have <strong>Triggers</strong>, which are specific conditions that outline the conditions the Action or Effects can be activated. Usually, these are in the \"Trigger\" field of the Action or Effect, but in some occasions may be found in the Effect Text.</p>\n<p>After a “triggering condition” occurs (an attack is declared, damage is taken, a Status Condition is/would be applied, an Ability is triggered) there is a window for any other combatant to trigger a reaction effect (aka something that has a trigger that is now met due to the activation of this effect), and this can chain infinitely in theory before returning to the original triggering condition.</p>\n<p>When an Effect is declared, or due to occur, actors can trigger effects of their own, as many triggers that are met from this condition but each only once in response to that Effect.</p>\n<p>If multiple actors wish to trigger their own effects in response to an Effect, those triggered Effects are resolved <em>in current initiative order</em>. This means that the resolution of a triggered effect from a \"faster\" actor can invalidate the trigger for a future actor (when an attack hitting is the trigger, Actor B activates Protect in response, and Actor C's \"when an ally hits an enemy\" triggering effect fails because the trigger is no longer applicable).</p>\n<h1>Special Actions</h1>\n<h2>Grappling</h2>\n<p><strong>Grapple</strong> is a unique battle state that can be initiated with the \"Grapple\" Action. Grappling, like in other TTRPGs, is used to pin down opponents and for more physical battlefield control.</p>\n<p>By default, a creature can initiate a Grapple using the <em>Grab</em> Action, though other Actions, Attacks, and Abilities can result in a Grapple. Grab's Accuracy Roll incorporates bonuses and penalties (included as situational ACC stages), as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This roll is based on the difference in Size Categories between the user and the target. This formula is: <code>(userCatMod-targetCatMod)/2</code>, rounded up if positive, rounded down if negative.<ul>\n<li>This makes it so that it's easier for large creatures to grapple smaller ones.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<p>On a hit, the user then makes a Lift check, with a Challenge Rating set based on the difference in Weight Classes between the user and the target.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This is calculated as: <code>(userWC-targetWC) / 2</code> rounded up if positive or down if negative.<ul>\n<li>Similar principle to the above, Grappling is easier if you're heavier than your target.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<p>On a success, the user and target gain the Grapple Condition, with the user being in control of the Grapple.</p>\n<h3>The Grappled Condition</h3>\n<p>While creatures possess the Grapple Condition, they have their default ACC and EVA each decreased by 1, and may only take Actions that possess the <strong>[Grapple]</strong> Trait. Creatures that are not in control of a Grapple are also considered to be Bound, whereas the creature in control of the Grapple may still move themselves normally.</p>\n<p>However, the creature in control is treated as having the other participant(s) Mounted onto itself, imposing a penalty to the creature's Movement Scores, equal to:</p>\n<p><code>Penalty = mountWC - riderWC + mountLift/10</code>, where:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Penalty</code> &lt; 0</li>\n<li><code>riderWC</code> is calculated by summing up all of the passenger creatures' weights</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If this penalty causes a creature to drop to 0 Movement Score overall, they are unable to move themselves and the Grappled creature(s).</p>\n<h3>Additional Participants</h3>\n<p>Whenever anyone uses the Grapple Action, any creature that has both the initiator and target of the Grapple within their Reach may voluntarily join the Grapple with the \"Co-Grapple\" Action on whichever side they choose.</p>\n<p>For the purposes of any Skill Checks made due to an Action with the [Grapple] trait, that include either the Size or Weight class of the participants in their calculation, you add the total Size / Weight class values of all participants on a side together, including the initial Accuracy Roll and Lift Test.</p>",

The Trigger you specify can be as general as “anything that enters range will be targeted and attacked” or more specific as needed. Keep in mind that if the Trigger doesn't occur, the action is lost. If the Delay Action is triggered as an Interrupt, you must pay the Action Cost from your next Activation as if it was a regular Interrupt Action.\n\n# Making Attacks\n\nIn order to make an attack, the player must first declare that they are intending to do so. Afterward, determine the targeting of the attack appropriately  (whether Area of Effect, etc).\n\nThe system will automatically expend the necessary PP, but you may have to deduct additional PP manually in the event of using Move Traits such as \\[Pass-X\\].\n\nWhen initiating the attack by clicking on the attack's icon in your HUD, it will bring up any applicable automation. Here you will be able to see any range increment penalties being applied, and any modifiers that may need to be manually activated or de-activated.\n\nAfter resolving the attack, the GM can override Hit and Critical Hit status if necessary by clicking on the hit/miss indicator. A small targeting reticule also will be present on the chat card. Targeting can be overriden and the attack re-resolved (such as in the case of an Intercept) against the new target by holding the Alt key and clicking this reticule.\n\n## Targeting and Range\nAll Actions, not just Attacks, and including Abilities, have both a **Target** and a **Range**. Targeting impacts how a target for an Action is selected, and whether or not a template may be used. These targets are as follows:\n\n- **Self**: Always listed at Range \"Om\", these Actions target the user exclusively. \n- **Creature**: These Actions generally target another creature.\n- **Ally**: Rather than all creatures, these Actions may only target an allied creature, excluding the user.\n- **Enemy**: Rather than all creatures, these Actions may only target an enemy creature.\n- **Object**: Instead of a creature, these Actions target an Object. Note: this may also mean they may be able to target an otherwise empty space.\n- **Blast**: These Actions target a space within range, and affect a spherical area centered on that space. The radius of the sphere is dependent on the the [Blast X] trait the Action possesses, being equal to X.5m.\n- **Cone**: These Actions target a Cone-shaped area, centered on a space the user occupies (user's choice). These Cones are templates that are X.5m long, in a direction the user chooses, with a Cone angle of 75°.\n- **Line**: These Actions target creatures in a line-shaped template Xm long, affecting creatures in the spaces the line crosses.\n- **Wide Line**: These Actions target creatures in a rectangle-shaped template, affecting creatures in the spaces the rectangle passes through, length of Xm. The width of the ray is dependent on the creature's Size, at minimum 2m.\n- **Emanation**: These Actions emanates Xm from the edges of the user’s token, affecting valid targets within this range. Functionally, this is a circle with a radius of X+Ym, where Y = half of the user token’s side length, minimum 0.5, centered on the user's center space.\n- **Field**: These Actions affect every creature in a scene or combat. This is generally all creatures in a local vicinity or \"encounter\", though the definition is flexible and usually defined by the GM.\n- **Aura**: Function identically to Emanations, but are always active instead of a one-time effect or Action.\n- **Allied Aura**: As Aura, but only affecting allied creatures.\n- **Enemy Aura**: As Aura, but only affecting enemy creatures.\n\n> **[Contact]** Actions function a little differently - their Range is influenced by the user's **Reach**, with their Range being `ActionRange + UserReach - 1`.\n\n> **Note**: Actions, in their effect text, may specify additional conditions to fulfill, or even an additional or expanded range/targeting mechanic past the Action's Targeting field. _Make sure you're always reading effect texts carefully!_\n\n### Range Increments\n**Range Increments** are the “effective range” of an Action, where it’s most effective. Past the first Range Increment (RI1), you receive compounding Range Increment Penalties (RIP) that affect your effective accuracy for the attack:\n- **RI1**: normal\n- **RI2**: -1 ACC\n- **RI3**: -3 ACC\n- **RI4**: -6 ACC\n- **RI5+**: Attack failure\n\nWhen you would accrue more than -6 ACC when at RI2 or further out, an Attack fails: not dealing damage, not activating secondary effects, not activating on-miss effects.\n\n_Area of effect and [Contact] Actions do not interact with Range Increments at all_ - they miss against targets outside of their listed/modified Range.\n\n## Effect Triggers\n\nA number of Actions or Effects have **Triggers**, which are specific conditions that outline the conditions the Action or Effects can be activated. Usually, these are in the \"Trigger\" field of the Action or Effect, but in some occasions may be found in the Effect Text.\n\nAfter a “triggering condition” occurs (an attack is declared, damage is taken, a Status Condition is/would be applied, an Ability is triggered) there is a window for any other combatant to trigger a reaction effect (aka something that has a trigger that is now met due to the activation of this effect), and this can chain infinitely in theory before returning to the original triggering condition.\n\nWhen an Effect is declared, or due to occur, actors can trigger effects of their own, as many triggers that are met from this condition but each only once in response to that Effect.\n\nIf multiple actors wish to trigger their own effects in response to an Effect, those triggered Effects are resolved _in current initiative order_. This means that the resolution of a triggered effect from a \"faster\" actor can invalidate the trigger for a future actor (when an attack hitting is the trigger, Actor B activates Protect in response, and Actor C's \"when an ally hits an enemy\" triggering effect fails because the trigger is no longer applicable).\n\n# Special Actions\n\n## Grappling\n\n**Grapple** is a unique battle state that can be initiated with the \"Grapple\" Action. Grappling, like in other TTRPGs, is used to pin down opponents and for more physical battlefield control.\n\nBy default, a creature can initiate a Grapple using the _Grab_ Action, though other Actions, Attacks, and Abilities can result in a Grapple. Grab's Accuracy Roll incorporates bonuses and penalties (included as situational ACC stages), as follows:\n\n-   This roll is based on the difference in Size Categories between the user and the target. This formula is: `(userCatMod-targetCatMod)/2`, rounded up if positive, rounded down if negative.\n    -   This makes it so that it's easier for large creatures to grapple smaller ones.\n\nOn a hit, the user then makes a Lift check, with a Challenge Rating set based on the difference in Weight Classes between the user and the target.\n\n-   This is calculated as: `(userWC-targetWC) / 2` rounded up if positive or down if negative.\n    -   Similar principle to the above, Grappling is easier if you're heavier than your target.\n\nOn a success, the user and target gain the Grapple Condition, with the user being in control of the Grapple.\n\n### The Grappled Condition\n\nWhile creatures possess the Grapple Condition, they have their default ACC and EVA each decreased by 1, and may only take Actions that possess the **\\[Grapple\\]** Trait. Creatures that are not in control of a Grapple are also considered to be Bound, whereas the creature in control of the Grapple may still move themselves normally.\n\nHowever, the creature in control is treated as having the other participant(s) Mounted onto itself, imposing a penalty to the creature's Movement Scores, equal to:\n\n`Penalty = mountWC - riderWC + mountLift/10`, where:\n\n-   `Penalty` < 0\n-   `riderWC` is calculated by summing up all of the passenger creatures' weights\n\nIf this penalty causes a creature to drop to 0 Movement Score overall, they are unable to move themselves and the Grappled creature(s).\n\n### Additional Participants\n\nWhenever anyone uses the Grapple Action, any creature that has both the initiator and target of the Grapple within their Reach may voluntarily join the Grapple with the \"Co-Grapple\" Action on whichever side they choose.\n\nFor the purposes of any Skill Checks made due to an Action with the \\[Grapple\\] trait, that include either the Size or Weight class of the participants in their calculation, you add the total Size / Weight class values of all participants on a side together, including the initial Accuracy Roll and Lift Test.",

        "content": "<p>Throughout a battle, a creature can be temporarily afflicted with a affliction. Each affliction has a variety of effects such as dealing damage every Activation or affecting the actions that can be taken.</p>\n<p>Whenever a creature gains an affliction, the affliction has a \"Stack\" value. This value indicates the number of the afflicted creatures' Activations that must pass before the affliction ends. Any time the same Affliction is applied while a creature is afflicted by it, the Stack value from that effect is added to the active Affliction unless otherwise stated. A creature can be afflicted by multiple afflictions.</p>\n<p>Unlike other TTRPGs, most afflictions are not cleared by rolling a \"Save\", and the only way to clear them is by waiting out the number of Activations or using items, moves, and abilities.</p>\n<p>Afflictions are separated into three categories: <strong>Major Afflictions</strong>, <strong>Minor Afflictions</strong>, and <strong>Pseudo Afflictions</strong>.</p>\n<h1>Major Afflictions</h1>\n<p>Major Afflictions have a main effect and usually have other afflictions that apply as long as the Major Affliction is active. These are as follows:</p>\n<p><em>Burn</em> - The afflicted creature loses a Tick of HP at the end of each of their Activations.

The afflicted creature’s default SPATK stages are reduced by 1 while Poison is active.</p>\n<p><em>Blight</em> - At the end of the afflicted creature’s Activation, it loses X Stacks of Blight, where X is 2 ^of^ ^Activations^ ^passed^ ^with^ ^Blight^ and takes a Tick of HP per Stack lost. The afflicted creature’s default SPATK stages are reduced by 1 while Blight is active. When a creature receives Blight, it loses the Poison Affliction, with Blight gaining 33% of its remaining Poison Stacks as extra Stacks on Blight. When afflicted with Poisoned X while Blighted, the creature gains +1 to its Blight Stacks.</p>\n<p><em>Paralysis</em> - The afflicted creature's SPD is reduced by 50%. The creature also has Slowed while Paralysis is active.</p>\n<p><em>Drowsy</em> - The Power of all of the afflicted creature's attacks is reduced by 33%, and the creature cannot utilize the [Priority X] or [Interrupt X] capabilities of their Actions. The afflicted creature's default SPDEF stages are reduced by 1 while Drowsy is active.</p>\n<p><em>Nightmares</em> - This affliction can only be applied to Drowsy creatures. The Power of all of the afflicted creature's attacks is reduced by 50%, and the creature cannot utilize the [Priority X] or [Interrupt X] capabilities of their actions. The creature loses a Tick of HP at the end of each of its Activations and has their default SPDEF and ACC stages reduced by 1 while Nightmares is active. When a creature receives Nightmares, it loses the Drowsy Affliction, and gains 33% of its remaining Drowsy Stacks onto Nightmares, and further Nightmares Stacks cannot be applied.</p>\n<p><em>Frozen</em> - The afflicted creature is unable to use actions (either during its Activations or as interrupts/reactions), but takes 33% less damage from all sources. The afflicted creature's default EVA stages are reduced by 1, and has its SPD increased by 50%. Additional Frozen Stacks cannot be added while Frozen is on a creature. Each time a creature ticks down a Stack of Frozen, they gain two Stacks of Frostbite.</p>\n<p><em>Splinter</em> - The afflicted creature loses a Tick of HP when they are damaged by a Physical- or Special-Category attack.

Hindered applied from different sources have their own Stacks.</p>\n<p><em>Stunted</em> - When the afflicted creature recovers HP, that amount is reduced by 2 Ticks (to a minimum of 0 HP healed).</p>\n<p><em>Confused</em> - At the end of the afflicted creature's Activations, it has a 50% chance of using Fumble.</p>\n<p><em>Hyper Mode</em> - While afflicted with Hyper Mode, the afflicted creature gains +20% to all of its Movement Scores, while dealing and taking 15% more damage. As well, the user’s Shadow-Type attacks gain [Crit 1], or have their [Crit X] value increase by +1. At the start of the afflicted creature’s Activations, it has:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a 40% chance to act normally on that Activation,</li>\n<li>a 25% chance to be Choice-Locked 1 to Shadow-Type attacks,</li>\n<li>a 15% chance of ending its Activation and using Fumble,</li>\n<li>a 15% chance of using Backlash, and  </li>\n<li>a 5% chance to be cured of Hyper Mode.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Weary</em> - While a creature is Weary, its default ACC and EVA stages are based on its Weary value, X. Specifically, the default ACC and EVA stages are set to the negative sum of all X and all integers between 0 and X (Weary 1 sets the defaults to -1, 2 to -3, and 3 to -6). Weary is automatically increased by 1 when a creature Faints. When a creature has 4 or more Weary, it is unable to battle until they reduce their Weary. Weary cannot wear off on its own - a creature must deliberately Rest or consume Items such as Apples to remove Stacks of Weary.</p>\n<p><em>Blinded</em> - The afflicted creature is unable to see, ocularly.

The move in question is determined by the source of the disabled effect, usually being “the last attack the target used.” If this would prevent them from using any attack, they may Struggle instead.</p>\n<p><em>Nullified</em> - One of the afflicted creature’s abilities is negated, and cannot be activated or benefited from. The ability in question is determined by the source of the nullification, usually determined randomly.</p>\n<p><em>Suppressed</em> - The afflicted creature spends 50% more PP on all actions that use PP.</p>\n<p><em>Lifted</em> - the afflicted creature is held aloft, unable to act normally. The creature cannot use other than [Teleport] while Lifted and is otherwise considered Stuck for the duration. A Lifted creature also suffers -6 EVA stages.</p>\n<p><em>Raised</em> - While a creature is Raised, it is immune to attacks and effects with the [Earthbound] trait.</p>\n<p><em>Harden</em> - While under the effect of Harden, the afflicted creature’s [Contact] attacks have +20 Power, and their [Dash] attacks gain [Crit 1] or have their [Crit X] increase by +1.</p>\n<p><em>Sharpen</em> - While under the effect of Sharpen, the afflicted creature’s [Dash] attacks gain [Sharp], and their [Sharp] attacks gain [Crit 1] or have their [Crit X] increase by +1.</p>\n<p><em>Destined</em> - when the afflicted creature deals damage with a Damaging Attack to the source of Destined, the afflicted creature is inflicted with the same amount of damage.</p>\n<p><em>Disguised</em> - The user is not easily recognized by sight.

Additionally, a Braced creature is immune to critical damage. A creature loses the Brace affliction after it moves or makes an attack of its own accord.</p>\n<p><em>Duel</em> - while a creature is afflicted by Duel, the creature and the source of the affliction have [Crit 2] on attacks they use against one another, and take and deal 1/3 less damage from/to creatures other than themselves. Creatures afflicted with Duel and the source of the Duel are also Stuck. If either the source or afflicted creature Faint or are otherwise removed from battle, the Duel Affliction is removed.</p>\n<p><em>Engulfed</em> - While a creature is afflicted with Engulfed, it is also considered to be Bound and Stuck.

The creature in control of the Grapple is treated as having the non-in-control creature(s) as being Mounted on itself.<br />\nIf an afflicted creature is the only participant of a Grapple, they lose this affliction.</p>\n<h1>Pseudo Afflictions</h1>\n<p><strong>Pseudo Afflictions</strong> are not technically Status Afflictions, so effects that clear status afflictions or afflictions do not affect Pseudo Afflictions. They also tend to break the “conventional status rules”, so they’re included here.</p>\n<p><em>Fainted</em> - When a creature's HP reaches and remains at 0, it is afflicted with Fainted. A Fainted creature cannot use Actions, does not benefit from Abilities, and is cured of all [Major Affliction], [Minor Affliction], [Pseudo Affliction], and [Stat Change] effects.

        "content": "<p>Our Initiative system is a Speed based activation system, akin to what can be found in <em>Shadowrun</em>, <em>Pokemon Legends: Arceus</em> and <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>.</p>\n<p>This means that how often and when you go is primarily based on your speed statistic, in our case it is mostly based on the difference in speed between creatures; instead of your pure stat, allowing for nicely flowing combat where (way) higher-level creatures (like bosses) automatically gain the advantage.</p>\n<p>The very short tl;dr version:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Creatures act in Ascending Action Value order (Ties are resolved by comparing Base AV -&gt; RNG)</li>\n<li>Whenever someone’s turn begins, everyone's Action Value is reduced by your current Action Value (setting your own to 0)</li>\n<li>Whenever your turn ends, your Action Value is set to your Base Action Value</li>\n<li>The round has a Base Action Value of 100, therefore after 100 Action Value worth of turns has been taken; a new round begins, and always loses ties.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All creatures have an <strong><em>Action Value</em></strong> which decides the order of activations in any given encounter, whenever combat starts and “initiative is rolled”, everyone’s Action Value (the Initiative in Foundry; henceforth referred to as AV) is set to their Base Action Value (henceforth referred to as Base AV) which is calculated based on their <strong>SPD Stat</strong>, as well as the average level of all combatants in the current encounter.</p>\n<h1>Interations with other systems</h1>\n<h2>Conditions and Effects</h2>\n<p>A large number of Effects and Conditions many come with a <strong>Stack</strong> value, which indicates the number of the afflicted creatures' activations that must pass before the condition ends.</p>\n<p>For example, \"Poisoned 3\" means that at the end of your first Activation it goes down to Poisoned 2 -&gt; second activation Poisoned 1 -&gt; and at the end of the third activation the Poison would wear off.</p>\n<p>\"Stacks\", as the name implies, stack with each other, provided that they're the same effect or condition. A creature affected by Poisoned 2 that gets Poisoned 3, will instead of gain 2 instances of Poisoned and now have Poisoned 5. </p>\n<p>Some Effects may cause you to trigger multiple stacks of a condition per turn like Badly Poisoned allowing for an extra potent effect.</p>\n<p>\"Stage changing effects\", like those applied by Leer, Swords Dance, or Curse, work a tad differently. Each of these effects, while having variable effects, still apply unique, independent effects with their own Stacks, ticking down after each Activation. So two instances of Leer on a creature do not \"stack\", adding to the duration of the original effect, but instead are applied in parallel to a creature.</p>\n<p>For example, if a creature is affected by Leer, takes an Activation of its own, is effect by two more Leer, then starts another Activation, that creature will have unique instances of a Leer 4, a Leer 5, and a Leer 5 effects applied to it on that second Activation.</p>\n<h1>Action Advancing and Action Delay</h1>\n<p>Action Advancing and Action Delay are two mechanics that can alter a single activation of a creature by moving their turn up or down in the initiative tracker. The formula to calculate is quite simple:</p>\n<p>$$\nAV \\tiny 2 \\large = AV \\tiny 1 \\large - AV \\tiny Base \\large * \\bigg(Action Forward-Action Delay\\bigg)\n$$ </p>\n<p>So for example; you have an Action Value of 50 and a Base AV of 100, and you get delayed by 25%, your new Action Value would be <code>50 - 100 * (0 - 0.25) = 75</code>.

        "markdown": "Our Initiative system is a Speed based activation system, akin to what can be found in *Shadowrun*, *Pokemon Legends: Arceus* and *Honkai: Star Rail*.\r\n\r\nThis means that how often and when you go is primarily based on your speed statistic, in our case it is mostly based on the difference in speed between creatures; instead of your pure stat, allowing for nicely flowing combat where (way) higher-level creatures (like bosses) automatically gain the advantage.\r\n\r\nThe very short tl;dr version:\r\n- Creatures act in Ascending Action Value order (Ties are resolved by comparing Base AV -> RNG)\r\n- Whenever someone’s turn begins, everyone's Action Value is reduced by your current Action Value (setting your own to 0)\r\n- Whenever your turn ends, your Action Value is set to your Base Action Value\r\n- The round has a Base Action Value of 100, therefore after 100 Action Value worth of turns has been taken; a new round begins, and always loses ties.\r\n\r\nAll creatures have an **_Action Value_** which decides the order of activations in any given encounter, whenever combat starts and “initiative is rolled”, everyone’s Action Value (the Initiative in Foundry; henceforth referred to as AV) is set to their Base Action Value (henceforth referred to as Base AV) which is calculated based on their **SPD Stat**, as well as the average level of all combatants in the current encounter.\r\n\r\n# Interations with other systems\r\n## Conditions and Effects\r\nA large number of Effects and Conditions many come with a **Stack** value, which indicates the number of the afflicted creatures' activations that must pass before the condition ends.\r\n\r\nFor example, \"Poisoned 3\" means that at the end of your first Activation it goes down to Poisoned 2 -> second activation Poisoned 1 -> and at the end of the third activation the Poison would wear off.\r\n\r\n\"Stacks\", as the name implies, stack with each other, provided that they're the same effect or condition. A creature affected by Poisoned 2 that gets Poisoned 3, will instead of gain 2 instances of Poisoned and now have Poisoned 5. \r\n\r\nSome Effects may cause you to trigger multiple stacks of a condition per turn like Badly Poisoned allowing for an extra potent effect.\r\n\r\n\"Stage changing effects\", like those applied by Leer, Swords Dance, or Curse, work a tad differently. Each of these effects, while having variable effects, still apply unique, independent effects with their own Stacks, ticking down after each Activation. So two instances of Leer on a creature do not \"stack\", adding to the duration of the original effect, but instead are applied in parallel to a creature.\r\n\r\nFor example, if a creature is affected by Leer, takes an Activation of its own, is effect by two more Leer, then starts another Activation, that creature will have unique instances of a Leer 4, a Leer 5, and a Leer 5 effects applied to it on that second Activation.\r\n\r\n# Action Advancing and Action Delay\r\nAction Advancing and Action Delay are two mechanics that can alter a single activation of a creature by moving their turn up or down in the initiative tracker. The formula to calculate is quite simple:\r\n\r\n$$\r\nAV \\tiny 2 \\large = AV \\tiny 1 \\large - AV \\tiny Base \\large * \\bigg(Action Forward-Action Delay\\bigg)\r\n$$ \r\n\r\nSo for example; you have an Action Value of 50 and a Base AV of 100, and you get delayed by 25%, your new Action Value would be `50 - 100 * (0 - 0.25) = 75`. Similarly, advancing forward by 25% would result in a new AV of 25.\r\n## Duration of Action Advancement/Delay \r\nOne thing to keep in mind is that the Action Advancement & Delay stack cumulatively, this means in the example above if you Delay for 25% to a new AV of 75, and then Advance for 25%, you calculate it as `75 - 100 * 0.25 = 50` -> effectively no change.\r\n\r\nIf a turn has passed and your AV has been lowered by 30, leaving you with 45 AV, the advance forward of 25% would still drop you by `25 -> 45 - 100 * 0.25 = 20`\r\n## Advance Forward 100% vs Immediately take Action\r\nExpanding off the above: there is a difference between \"Advancing forward by 100%\" and \"Immediately take action\". Any Effect that Advances Forward by 100% does so using the calculation above; meanwhile an Effect that makes you \"Immediately take action\" sets your AV to 0 with no further math included.\r\n## Advancement and Delay Caps\r\nDue to concerns of outright “locking down” creatures, the absolute highest AV~2~ that can be reached through net increase in AV (meaning, Action Delay exceeding Action Forward) is 100 AV. Advancement, however, has no cap going down besides the absolute limit of 0 AV.\r\n# Speed Alteration\r\nA change in speed of △SPD~1→2~ will lead to a change in Base AV, calculated like so:\r\n\r\n$$\r\nAV _{Base2} = AV _{Base1} * \\frac{SPD _1}{SPD _2} = AV _{Base1} * \\bigg(1- \\frac{\\Delta SPD}{SPD _1 + SPD _2} \\bigg)\r\n$$\r\n\r\nEvery time another SPD (de-)buff is applied it will change the current base AV multiplicatively; this holds true for Speed Combat Stages too. Meaning the speed increase/decrease stacks additively:\r\n\r\n$$\r\nAV_{k} = AV _{Base1} * \\frac{SPD _1}{SPD _2}* \\frac{SPD _2}{SPD _3} *...* \\frac{SPD _{k-1}}{\\small SPD _k}\r\n$$\r\n\r\n$$\r\n= AV _{Base1} * \\bigg( 1- \\frac{\\Delta SPD}{SPD _1 + SPD _{1→k}} \\bigg)\r\n$$ \r\n\r\nThis alteration of the base stat also alters the current speed stat, the calculation for that would be as followed:\r\n\r\n$$\r\nAV _{inew} = AV _{iold} * \\frac{SPD _{old}}{SPD _{new}}\r\n$$ \r\n\r\nMaking the total formula for calculating a change to the current AV the following:\r\n\r\n> equation to-do\r\n\r\n# Combat Round Breakdown\r\n> TODO: Add full example here\r\n\r\n# Math\r\nSee [Math for Nerds](/rules/combat/math-for-nerds) if you wish to see the in-depth math.\r\n\r\n> TODO: Remove equations as much as possible from this page.",

At +5 and +6 SPD stages, it is 45 and 100, and at -5 and -6, it is set to 95 and 150.\n\n## The Sigmoid Compression\nUtilizing the above upper and lower bounds, as well as the absolute extreme bounds (45 and 150), the above `BaseAV` is \"compressed\" to the above upper and lower bounds using what is referred to as a *\"sigmoid function\"*.\n\nThe sigmoid function essentially \"normalizes\" a number, attempting to bring it within some set of arbitrary bounds (in this case, the absolute extreme bounds), to essentially soften the \"extremes\" that can occur with the speed calculation (such as with speedsters like Deoxys or Regieleki or absolute slowpokes like Shuckle or Geodude).\n\nFirst, the calculated d baseAV is placed onto a scale of -3.5 and +3.5, via the formula:\n$$\nnormalized = 7* ((baseAV - 45) / 105) - 3.5 \n$$\nThen, the normalized number is \"compressed\", using the hyperbolic function that utilizes the special properties of Euler's number, *e*:\n$$\ncompressed = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-normalized}}\n$$\nFrom here, the compressed AV value is scaled back to the normal bounds:\n$$\neffectiveAV = compressed * 105 + 45\n$$\nAnd is then bound to the above-determined Upper and Lower bounds (based on the creature's SPD stages).\n\n# Accuracy and Damage Calculation\n## Accuracy Roll\nNearly identical to the VGs' formula, this system's accuracy formula is as follows:\n\n$$\nDC_{Acc} = \\left\\lfloor Accuracy_{Action}+Modifier_{Flat} \\right\\rfloor * StageBonus +Modifier_{Percentile}\n$$\n\n> **Note 1**: `Modifier`~`Flat`~ and `Modifier`~`Percentile`~ are the modifiers present on the Accuracy Roll dialog window.\n\n$$\nStageBonus = max(-6, min(6, ACC_{user}-EVA_{target}))\n$$\n\n> **Note 2**: The ACC and EVA values here are determined not only based on the Stages of the user and target, but also include modifiers from the Accuracy Roll dialog window and factors such as Range Increment Penalty.\n\n## Damage Roll\nNearly identical to the VGs' formula, this system's damage formula is as follows:\n\n$$\nDamage = \\left\\lfloor Calc_{Power}*Targets*Critical*\\frac{100-2d8}{100}*STAB*Type_{Effectiveness}*Modifiers \\right\\rfloor \n$$\n\n> **Note 1**: The randomization factor was changed from a `d16` roll in the VGs to a `2d8` roll, to make Moves more consistent in terms of their damage output.\n\n$$\nCalc_{Power} = \\left(\\frac{\\left(0.75*\\frac{2+Level_{attacker}}{5}+2\\right)*Power*\\frac{ATK}{DEF}} {50}+2\\right)\n$$\n\n> **Note 2**: The constant value, the `0.75` is included in the damage calculations, in order to reduce the swingy nature of Damage from the VGs, and the reducing the ease at which a creature can deal enough damage to Faint a target.\n\n$$\nTargets = \\begin{cases} \n          1 & Num_{target} = 1 \\\\\n          0.75 & Num_{target} > 1 \\\\\n       \\end{cases}\n$$\n\n$$\nCritical = \\begin{cases} \n          1 & \\small\\text{Normal Hit} \\\\\n          1.5 & \\small\\text{Critical Hit} \\\\\n       \\end{cases}\n$$\n\n$$\nSTAB \\tiny{\\text{(Same Type Attack Bonus)}} \\normalsize = \\begin{cases} \n          1 & \\footnotesize\\text{User does not share a Type with Attack} \\\\\n          1.5 & \\footnotesize\\text{User shares a Type with Attack} \\\\\n       \\end{cases}\n$$\n\n$$\nType_{Effectiveness} = \\begin{cases} \n          0 & \\scriptsize\\text{Defender is immune to Attack Type.} \\\\\n          2^{Types_{weak}- Types_{resist}} & \\scriptsize\\text{Defender has Types that resist or are weak to Attack Type.} \\\\\n       \\end{cases}\n$$\n\n> **Note 3**: This calculation factors in the results of multiple-typed Attacks, however the calculation only considers the \"best\" result vs each foe's Type (ie, Fighting/Flying Attack vs a Rock/Ground/Grass Type results in a `Type`~`Effectiveness`~ of **`4`**, due to Rock being weak to Fighting, and Grass being weak to Flying).\n\n$$\nModifiers = \\footnotesize\\text{modifiers from Attacks, Abilities, Perks, Gear, etc.}\n$$",
