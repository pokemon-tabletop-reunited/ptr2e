        "description": "The user may have a creature smaller than the user's CatMod stored as a [Stash] item. If the user is hit by an attack while it has a creature held as a [Stash] item, they may freely use Fling with the creature, with the user's Lift being treated as +30 higher per difference in CatMods. When using Fling in this way, Fling has a 20% chance to reduce the target's DEF stage by -1 on hit, a 20% chance to reduce their SPDEF stage by -1 on hit, and a 20% chance to inflict Paralyzed 5 on hit.\nThe user, as part of using Surf or another [Set Up] Attack, can spend 2 PP to procure a wild Arrokuda (or suitable fish Pokemon for the area) as a [Stash] item (or done without a PP cost as part of an Exploration or Downtime Action). The user can spend 4 PP to attempt to do so on a valid enemy or willing ally on its Activation as a Complex Action, by making an Opposed Grapple Test, with the user's Lift being treated as +30 higher per difference in CatMods.",
