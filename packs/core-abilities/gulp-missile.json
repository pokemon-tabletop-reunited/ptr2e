				"description": "The user changes to Gulping Form, preparing and equipping an Arrocuda for 2 activations. If the user is hit by an attack while in Gulping Form, the user retaliates against the attacker by throwing the Arrocuda at the attacker, dealing 1/4 of the attacker's Max HP as damage as well as reducing the attackers DEF stage by -1 for 5 activations. If the user's health is lower than 1/2 their Max HP, they change into Gorging Form instead and equips a Pikachu instead for 2 activations. Gorging Form's retaliation attack deals 1/4 of the attacker's health as damage and Inflicts Paralyzed 5. If the user is not attacked while in either form before the duration ends, they change back to their base forme and lose the equipped Pokemon.",
