Passive: The user can equip a Type Plate item without using their Accessory Slot, and the user's type changes to match the Type Plate. If the user has two different Type Plates equipped, the user gains both types. If the user possesses the Legend Plate, Judgement instead always receives STAB and always deals damage as if it was one step super-effective.",
