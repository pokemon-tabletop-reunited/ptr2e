When equipped to a Dondozo whose HP is less than 1/2 their Max HP, Tatsugiri sets its HP to 0 and increases Dodonzo's ATK, DEF, SPATK, SPDEF, and SPD Stages by +2 for 5 Activations as a Free Action. If the ally Dodonzo gains @Affliction[fainted] while equipped with the user, the user is brought out onto the field in an open space adjacent to the ally Dondozo. This Ability can only be used once per combat.</p>"
