An equipped Tatsugiri is unable to perform any actions besides the Free Action of this ability. When equipped to a Dodonzo whose HP is less than 1/2 their Max HP, Tatsugiri sets it's HP to 0 and increases Dodonzo's ATK stage, DEF stage, SPATK stage, SPDEF stage, and Speed stage by +2 for 5 activations as a Free Action. If Dodonzo faints while equipped with an Active Tatsugiri, Tatsugiri is brought out onto the field in an open space adjacent to Dodonzo. This ability can only be used once per combat.",
