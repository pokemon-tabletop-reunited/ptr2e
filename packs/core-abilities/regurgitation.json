On success, the user Engulfs the target, equpping the creature as a [Stash] item.The user can only have one creature Engulfed at a time. An Engulfed creature cannot act or be affected by actions or effects in any way, except to free itself with a -20 Grapple check.\nWhen the user hits a target with an attack while it has an Engulfed creature, it deals a Tick of HP damage to the target. This damage possesses the Type(s) of the Engulfed creature.\nIf the user Faints, the Engulfed creature may freely escape if it chooses, appearing in a space adjacent to the user.",
