Using a Normal-Type attack means the user becomes Mega Eevee/Companeon. When it changes species, it swaps its current Basic, Advanced, and Master Abilities for those of the selected species (but retains this Ability), and the user may swap up to 2 attacks on its Active List with attacks in its Repertoire.",
