Until the user's next Activation, the selected Action gains [Interrupt 1], and the user specifies a Trigger for it to possess. The Trigger can be as general as “anything that enters the Action's range will be targeted and attacked” or more specific as needed. On meeting the Trigger, the user may use the selected Attack or Action as a Free Action, consuming PP as normal.</p>",
